George Jones was indicted for having, with others unknown, on the 12th May assaulted and put
in bodily fear, James Cropley, and stolen from his person three £1 notes, sixteen half crowns,
twenty shillings and twenty sixpences.
</p><p>
The prosecutor stated, that on the 12th May, in the evening, he went to the back yard of the
Golden Fleece, where he was attacked by six or seven men, knocked down and robbed of the money
charged.
</p><p>
Upon being questioned by the Judge, Cropley declined to swear to the identity of the prisoner,
and His Honor said no Jury could convict after the answers of the witness. There was no other
testimony, and the prisoner was discharged.
</p><p>
Mr. Croke said the prosecutor swore most positively to the prisoner at the Police Office.

INQUEST.
</p><p>
Dr Wilkins, held an inquest at Mount Cotterell, last Wednesday, upon the body of a
farmer, named Samuel Cropley, of that neighbourhood, who was .accidentally killed on the
morning of the previous day, by a heavy dray parsing over his chest, According to the
evidence of the brother, George Oropley, he and the deceased were going for wood in two
drays, and started about hall-past nine o'clock..
</p><p>
Just as they started deceased's horses ran away, and it is supposed that the deceased was
knocked down either by the horses or by the shaft of the dray, as he fell immediately under
the near wheel, which passed over his chest.
</p><p>
The poor fellow spoke a word or two, and died almost immediately.
A verdict of accidental death was returned.

PROSECUTIONS UNDER THE SCAB ACT.
</p><p>
Scab seems to universally affect the sheep in the Werribee district. Yesterday, the Williamstown
Police Bench were occupied more than four hours investigating prosecutions for violations
of the Scab Act brought by Mr. Philip Riley, Government scab inspector, against three farmers
living in that neighbourhood. The first case was against John Cropley, farmer, of Rock Bank.
In respect to this defendant, Mr. Riley said he visited the defendant's farm, on the Kororoit
Creek, on the 28rd of June last, and found there 260 sheep, whose scabbiness he detected by
examination. In six of the flock he saw, by means of a magnifying-glass, the scab insect alive
in tho sheep's flesh ; and, moreover, he took portions of the wool of the six sheep home,
and subjected them to a powerful microscope, which even more plainly showed the living insect.
For the defence, it was urged that tho sheep were not scabby, that they had been dipped nine
days before, that the signs on the sheep's skins were produced by a change from spare feed
to rank grass, and that the scab in the pieces of wool taken away was probably caught from
other specimens. Three witnesses, namely, Simon Searle, T. B. Durham, and Wm. Orme, were called
to prove the dipping, and the probability of the symptoms not indicating scab; but the Bench
held that Mr. Riley's evidence was not disproved, and inflicted a fine of £39, or 3s. for
each sheep, and £3 8s. cost.

DROWNED IN A WATERHOLE.
</p><p>
An inquest was held at Red Hill farm, Truganina, by Dr. Maclean, on Tuesday afternoon, upon
the body of Sydney Joseph Bickford, a boy eight years old. He was returning from school along
with another boy named Cropley, on the previous day, and in passing a waterhole they commenced
playing around it. Cropley prepared to go home, and as he left he saw the deceased throw a
stick into the water. He then heard a cry, and on going back to the hole, he saw Bickford
in the water. Cropley jumped into the hole and tried to get hold of the deceased, but did
not succeed. Witness then called to him to paddle into shallow water, as he could not reach
him. But he soon sank, and Cropley ran home and gave an alarm. A Mrs. Clark immediately got
a rake and proceeded to the hole; but she could see no body, nor could she find anything with
the rake. She then called the assistance of a Mr Chas. Clamp from a neighboring farm. The
man went back to the hole and got out the body, which was still warm. Every effort was made
to procure respiration, but without effect. The jury returned a verdict that the deceased
was accidentally drowned while at play. The deceased was a stranger in the neighbourhood,
being only there on a visit.

On Monday evening, 1st March, an occurrence of a most distressing character took place at
Truganina, the Plains. A lad named Sidney Bickford, who had been residing for a short time
with Mr. G. Cropley, Red Hill, on returning from the Derrimut Common School, passing by a
water hole in Mr. Clarke's paddock, was amusing himself by throwing into the water a piece
of wood, when losing his balance he fell in. A lad who was with him, Alfred Cropley, pluckily
waded in and tried to get him out; but finding that the water was too deep, he ran home and
obtained assistance, but too late, When taken out of the water, life was extinct. An inquest
was held on Tuesday evening, when a verdict of "accidentally drowned" was returned. Immediately
after, the father took the body for interment to Melbourne. Sincere sympathy is felt for the
poor mother, who has been recently confined, and has not yet recovered. Besides her infant,
Sydney was her only surviving child.

MAGISTERIAL ENQUIRY AT SOUTH WARRAGUL. A magisterial enquiry was held at South Warragul on
Sunday, 5th inst., by Charles Sargeant, Esq., J.P., touching the death of a youth named Herbert
Cropley, when the following evidence was adduced:- Benjamin Cropley deposed:-I am a farmer,
residing at South Warragul. I identify the body as that of my son, Herbert Cropley aged thirteen
years. I saw him last alive about noon on Saturday, 4th October. After dinner he went out
to cut down a tree. When the tree was about to fall, he called to his mother to come and see
it fall. When I heard the tree fall, my wife called out to me. I ran out at once, and saw
the deceased lying on the ground, with his face downwards. I picked him up, and then saw a
scalp wound on his head, from which blood was flowing. I carried him into the house. I believe
he breathed for about three quarters of an hour. I am satisfied that the deceased was killed
accidentally by the tree he was felling. Elizabeth Jane Cropley deposed :- The deceased was
my son. I was watching him fell a tree yesterday. He said to me, just before the tree fell,
"Mother you will hear a crash directly." I saw a limb of the falling tree strike him. I called
his father, who immediately came to his assistance. I am satisfied the death was purely accidental.
Effield Samuel Cropley deposed- I reside with my parents. The deceased was my cousin. I was
in deceased's company yesterday, assisting him to cut down a tree. When the tree was falling,
I went in an opposite direction to that taken by deceased. I did not hear deceased say anything.
As he was running away, I saw a branch strike him on the head, and he fell to the ground.
I took the limb off him, when I saw blood on the ground. At this time deceased's mother arrived
at the spot. Mr. Sargeant's finding was as follows :-" I am fully of opinion that the deceased,
Herbert Cropley, came by his death in accordance with the evidence given, and that it was
purely accidental."

At the local court on Wednesday morning, two young females whose ages were 21 and 22
years' respectively, and named Jessie Charles and Margaret Cropley were charged with using
obscene language the previous evening, about ten o'clock. They were using very vile
language in Anderson street to some larrikins, and when Constable Harris came to Constable
Conn's assistance, a very large crowd estimated at over a hundred persons had collected. The
females were arrested, both being under the influence of liquor, and they treated the constables 
to a choice assortment of Billingsgate expressions. In the meantime Senior-Constable Rushford 
arrived, and the prisoners were removed to the watch-house, one of them
having to be carried all the way. They were each fined £5 or two months' imprisonment,
and as the fines were not paid went to gaol.

FATAL BLOW FROM A CONSTABLE'S BATON.
</p><p>
The man Henry Cousins, who was knocked down on Wednesday last by Constable Spillane
when Cousins was, as the constable alleges, making an assault upon him, died in the 
Melbourne Hospital yesterday afternoon from the results of the injuries he received. He was 
insensible when he was admitted to the hospital, and never recovered consciousness. A post 
mortem examination will be made in the course of to-day, and an inquest will be held on Monday
next.
</p><p>
Warrants were issued yesterday for the arrest of the three men who were with Cousins at the
time of the fracas. Constables M'Donnell and M'Evilly assisted Constable Spillane to trace
and arrest the offenders. They succeeded in effecting the arrest of Henry Cropley,
aged 23, of no occupation, who lives with his mother at Victoria-street, West
Brunswick. The charge preferred against Cropley is that of using threatening
language, and it will also be alleged against him that he was the one who carried the sling shot,
whilst is was Cousins who used the belt. Cropley was arrested at the house of the deceased man,
Cousins, 75 Cambridge-street, Collingwood.

DESTRUCTIVE FIRE AT SOUTH WARRAGUL.
</p><p>
Many of our readers will regret to hear of the loss sustained by Mr. Effield Cropley senr.,
whose residence at South Warragul and all its contents, were entirely destroyed by fire at
half past one on Friday morning. The family were asleep at the time of the outbreak and were
eventually awakened by the crackling of the flames and the suffocating density of the smoke.
Immediately the alarm was given every member of the family had to rush from the house to save
their lives. They had not even an opportunity of obtaining their clothes and it was utterly
impossible to take any valuables out of the burning building. The fire had secured such a
hold before its discovery was made that very shortly afterwards the house and furniture were
a roaring mass of flames, and' the family considered themselves fortunate in having escaped
with their lives. The origin of the fire is unknown. We understand that the total insurance
on the house and furniture was only £100. If this information is correct, Mr. Cropley will
certainly be a very heavy loser.

McGowan) acting as bridesmaid while Mr. J. Cropley undertook the duties of "best man" to his
brother. After the ceremony was over, the bridal party and friends adjourned to the home of

Annie Teresa Cropley, formerly Darragh, petitioned for a dissolution of her marriage with
Clark Cropley, on the ground of desertion. The parties were married in June, 1885, at Fitzroy,
Melbourne, according to the Baptist rites. Petitioner said that in 1892 they came to Sydney,
and took furnished apartments. In December, 1894, the respondent was working at the Waverley
Brewery, and one day he came home, and ordered her out of the house, saying that as she "went
out the front door he had a woman coming in at the back door." She subsequently went to Melbourne,
and in March, 1895, after she had returned, she saw a woman at a house at Bondi. While she
was there, the respondent came up, and she spoke to him, and he said that 'he would not make
a home for her, but if she liked she could stay there, and he would pay. She remained there
for four weeks, at the end of which time the woman told her that her board had not been paid
for. She asked her husband for money, and he refused to give her any. The woman afterwards
put her out of the house, and later she sued the respondent for maintenance. She had not seen
him since August, 1896. His Honour granted a decree nisi, to be moved absolute in six months.

<b>WEDDING</b>. CROPLEY--TINKLER. WERRIBEE was all astir on Wednesday, 29th March, when Miss
Elsie Maud Tinkler, eldest daughter of a Mr. and Mrs. John Tinkler, was married to Mr. Walter
Henry Cropley, of Truganina. Long before 3 p.m., the hour appointed for the ceremony, the
Methodist church, which had been most tastefully and artistically decorated, was packed. All
was expectancy, at last the whisper went round "here she comes." The organ pealed out the
"Wedding March,' played by Mrs. Comben. The wedding party arrived, and the knot was tied by
the Rev. H. W. Frederick. The bride wore soft white silk, trimmed with silk Maltese lace,
and sprays of orange blossom; a wreath and veil; and carried a beautiful bouquet of white
azaleas and fern, tied with white tulle. Her sister, Miss Emmie Tinkler, and Miss Grace Walter
were bridesmaids, and wore s pale buttercup silk, trimmed with silk lace; black picture hats,
and bouquets of red dahlias and autumn leaves. They also wore beautiful opal brooches, the
gift of the bride-groom. The bridegroom was supported by his cousin, Mr. Cropley, and Mr.
Mansley Walter. The youthful couple left the church amidst showers of rice and confetti,&nbsp;
and they and a very large number of guests adjourned to the Mechanics hall, where they did
full justice to a sumptuous breakfast provided by Mrs. Tinkler. The toast of "The Bride and
Bridegroom" was proposed by the officiating clergyman. The bridegroom feelingly responded.
Then followed the usual toasts, interspersed with songs "A world of praise," and "Woman's
way is best," by Miss Kearns; and "Ever so far away," by Miss Allardyce. The wedded couple
left for Melbourne, en route for Warrnambool. The bride's travelling dress was an emerald
green tweed, with black hat. In the evening a large number of young friends assembled in the
hall, at Mrs. Tinkler's invitation, and they spent a very pleasant time. In the afternoon
of the previous Sunday Miss Tinkler was presented with a marble clock as a token of appreciation
of her valuable work there. Mr. Pottenger made the presentation and wished her God speed in

WEDDING AT WARRAGUL AN INTERESTING EVENT. MR. ARTHUR CLARKE TO MISS MILLIE CROPLEY. One of
the most interesting weddings that have taken place in Warragul for many years past, was celebrated
at the Methodist Church on Wednesday afternoon, when Mr Arthur Clarke, son of Mrs E. Clarke,
of Warragul, was wedded to Miss Millie Cropley, daughter of Mr and Mrs E. S. Cropley, of Darnum.
The officiating clergyman was the Rev. G. R. Neilson. The church, which was crowded, was very
tastefully decorated by the choir and friends of the bride and bridegroom, and from the wedding
arch near the pulpit was suspended the wedding bell, emblematical of the joy and harmony which
should be the characteristic features of young lives, joined together in holy matrimony. As
the bride entered the church the choir sang very sweetly "The Voice that Breathed O'er Eden."
As the strains of the beautiful composition died away, the solemn compact of the marriage
service was commenced and on its completion the happy couple adjourned to sign the register,
when Mr Dodds played the "Wedding March" and Mrs Neilson sang the beautiful solo' God Be With
You." The bride, who looked very charming and happy, was given away by her father. She wore
a very handsome costume of white satin with silk applique and pearl trimmings. She also wore
the usual wreath and veil and carried a beautiful bouquet of white chrysanthemums A lovely
pendant set with amethysts, the gift of the bridegroom, encircled her neck. The bride was
attended by four brides maids, the Misses Pearl Cropley (sister of the bride). Lily Bailey
(Yarragon), and the little Misses Edna Smith (cousin of the bride), and Lila Neilson. They
were all charmingly dressed in creme crepe de cheme. The Misses Pearl Cropley and Lily Bailey
carried lovely shower bouquets of pink carnations, and the little maids had pretty baskets
of white flowers adorned with chiffon streamers. Each wore a pretty gold brooch the gift of
the bridegroom. The bridegroom had as best man Mr W. Smith, while Mr E. Cropley filled the
position of groomsman, After the ceremony the company adjourned to the school hall, where
the happy pair- whose path had been strewn with roses by the little bridesmaids-received their
guests with a cordial handshake from the 'bridegroom and gracious smiles from the bride. The
building had been very lavishly decorated and the tables, which were very nicely arranged
by Mrs Martin and Mrs Fry, were ladened with all the choice accessories of the wedding feast.
The Rev. G. R. Neilson presided and proposed, after the loyal toast, the health of "The Bride
and Bridegroom." In the course of a felicitous speech Mr Neilson said that the bridegroom
was one of the most useful members of the church. He had been associated with the Warragul
church for about eight years. He was a the best secretary the Trust had ever had, and as choir
master. they all knew his sterling worth. He had never spared himself in the past and he was
glad to v know that he would continue to hold his old positions in the future. In the bride
also the church realised that they had a treasure, who was always willing to give o her services
as organist, a position which she had held for over four years. They were glad to know, however,
that although she was now Mrs Arthur Clarke they were not to be altogether deprived of her
services, and that she would still take a deep interest in the church, and in her position
as organist. He wished them both health, happiness and success in all that lay before them
in the future. (Applause). The bridegroom made a suitable response, in which he thanked Mr
Neilson and all friends for their kindness and good in wishes. "The Bridesmaids" was proposed,
by the bridegroom, who give expression to some very pretty sentiments, which were responded
to and acknowledged by Mr W. Smith. "The Parents of the Bride" was a toast allotted to Mr
Dodds, of Darnum, who felt it was really unnecessary to extol the virtues of Mr and Mrs E.
S. Cropley, of Darnum, so well were they known for their kindness and generosity throughout
the district. Mr Cropley, who was called upon to respond, made a characteristic reply, in
which the modesty of Nature's gentleman was the distinguishing feature. "The Parents of the
Bridegroom " was proposed by Mr Fry, who testified to the high esteem in which Mrs Clarke
was held by all who knew her. Although he sympathised with her in losing a. son, he could
congratulate her on gaining such a charming daughter. (Hear, hear). Mr J. H. Ciarke, brother
of the bridegroom, responded on behalf of his mother. "*Our Guest," proposed by Mr W. Sykes,
of Melbourne, and the "Officiating Clergyman" were also proposed, the latter toast by Mr J.
H. Clarke causing Mr Neilson to blush to learn that he possessed so many excellent virtues.
The wedding function throughout was c very successful and all went "merry as a marriage hell"
The happy pair left by the evening train for Bairnsdale to spend their honeymoon. The bride's
travelling dress was of velvet of a pretty violet shade, with cream trimmings and cream felt
hat with ostrich plumes. A beautiful, set of fox furs added a charming finish to the costume.
A large number of beautiful presents were received as follows:- LIST OF PRESENTS. Bridegroom
to bride, amethyst pendant. Bride to bridegroom, set of gold sleeve links. Bridegroom to first
bridesmaid, crescent and ruby brooch; to second bridesmaid, three-bar heart centre brooch,

<b>DEATH</b> OF MRS. CROPLEY. YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. We regret to announce the death of one
of the oldest and most respected pioneers of the Warragul district-Mrs Ben. Cropley. The deceased
lady had reached a great age, and lately had been ailing, though it was not suspected that
the end was so near. She had kept her bed for some time, and yesterday afternoon, unsuspected
by any of the family, she passed away very quietly in her sleep. It was an ideal and peaceful
closing of a long and useful life. Mr. Ben. Cropley was in Warragul at the time, and when
word was conveyed to him of the sad event, he hurried home as soon as possible. Of course
it was a great shock, and deep sympathy will be felt for him and all the members of the family.
The social evening, which was to have been held at the Methodist schoolroom, on Wednesday
evening, has been postponed in consequence of this family bereavement.

<b>OBITUARY</b> CROPLEY On Wednesday evening, Mrs M. A. Cropley, mother of Mr H. Cropley,
of the "Independent" proprietary, passed away "at her home, 92.Paisley street Mrs Cropley
was 79 years of age, and as one of the earliest of the race of pioneers in this State saw
some interesting times;. Her husband, the: late John Cropley; was a farmer, and, 61 years
ago they settled down at rockhank. The farm was situated near the Kororoit Creek, opposite
Sir W. J. Clarke's Rockbank Station. For 34 years they carried on the farm there, rearing
a family of eight boys, William John, Charles, Melton, Crosby, Harry, Perry and Sydney, all
surviving their mother; with the exception :of the last mentioned. The primary producer had
to put up with some inconveniences those days. Fifty-years ago even the farmer at Rockbank
need not be surprised if a bushranger walked in. Mrs Cropley told of an interesting encounter
she had one morning with the notorious outlaws, Saunders and .Johnson and their followers..
Mrs Cropley was alone at the farmhouse when the band walked in. They quietly told her to prepare
dinner for them, and when it was ready sat down and ate a good meal. Just as he was leaving,
Saunders told Mrs Cropley whom he was. Though a bushranger, he was apparently a gentleman,
and throughout showed her marked courtesy. The bushrangers attempted to take nothing from
the farm. Saunders, when parting. said he did not war on defenceless women or anyone without
a chance against him. Then the bushrangers roved across country to Mr. Henry Cropley's farm
on the Exford road, where there were men about. They bailed them up and ransacked the place.
This was their last act of lawlessness. A few weeks later they were captured. Saunders was
hanged. Twenty seven years ago Mrs Cropley came to Footscray and brought up the younger members
of her family here. For some time she had been suffering from heart weakness. A bad cold contracted
a week before turned to pneumonia and caused her death. The funeral took place yesterday.
Mrs Cropley was buried in the family grave at Truganina, in the presence of many old friends.

<b>OBITUARY</b><b>.</b> Only those acquainted with the family fully realise how large a circle
of relatives and friends deplore the death of Mrs. Frank Cropley, who recently passed on to
a wider life. The Rev. J. H. Dawe has kindly given us the following particulars &ndash; Mrs.
Frank Cropley, nee Christina Munro, became a member of the Presbyterian Church, Warragul,
over 20 years ago, coming into Communion on Confession of Faith during the ministry of Rev.
Hay Hunter, M.A., in this congregation. For over 12 years she was a most diligent and conscientious
teacher and worker in our Sabbath school, only giving up this good work on entering upon her
married life four years ago. The marriage service was celebrated at Middle Park by Rev. Hunter.
Her married life was a very happy one, and was only saddened by the death of her little baby
girl, who died when only nine months old. How- ever, she bore this loss very bravely. She
was a good wife, daughter, sister and friend. She was loyal to her much beloved church, and
a true and faithful friend and relative. Her cheeriness of disposition and invariable courtesy
made her highly respected and beloved by all who came in contact with her influence, and simple,
sincere and Godly life. For about 15 years she was in one of the establishments of the town
where she endeared herself alike to the proprietors and shopmates of that firm. I have been
assured that no one, who was ever in that business, was more highly respected than she had
been and is. Mrs. Cropley lived a beautiful, simple Christian life, without the least suspicion
of cant or the parade of her religion. Her death was one to be envied; it was so free from
fear or shrinking from the last ordeal. To her friends she said, "This is a day of mourning
with you. but it should be a day of rejoicing." She died at "Cooinda" on Tuesday, Sept. 23rd.
after a week of acute pain, and from the church where a short service was held, she was taken
to her last resting place in the Warragul Cemetery on Thursday, Sept. 25th, and interred in
the presence of a large company of friends and mourners. Last Sabbath week morning an In Memoriam
Service was held in the Presbyterian Church, Warragul. There was a large attendance."

West Gippsland Gazette (Warragul) Tuesday 6 May 1924
</h3><p>
MR. BEN. CROPLEY. AN OLD PIONEER. DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARLY DAYS. LOOKING BACKWARD 89 YEARS.
"There were lion-hearted men in those days," is a phrase which truly describes the courage,
perseverance and endurance which characterised the men who subdued the primeval forest of
West Gippsland. There are very few of the original pioneers left now. We made reference to
one--Mr. John Meehan--the other day. Another is Mr. Charles Harkness, whose farm and homestead
is near Camp Hill. Still another, is Mr. Ben. Cropley, hale and hearty at his 89th year. He
is a living exemplification of the truth of the old saying that "hard work kills nobody."
For hard work, early and late, has been so much the lot of Mr. Cropley, that he can not even
at 89 get out of the habit. Though resident in Warragul with his daughters, he finds it necessary,
"for a little exercise," to go out to the farm at Darnum on two days a week. It seems wonderful
that a man of 89 should really delight in hard work. But Mr. Cropley comes of a prolific race,
and a long-lived one. In a chat at the "Gazette" office recently, we elicited a few facts
of his interesting career, and his memory of far-off events is astounding. Like all pioneers,
he is diffident in talking about himself and would only do so, in order to illustrate some
of the almost superhuman difficulties which confronted the early pioneers in clearing the
dense forest where the fair town of Warragul now stands. "Very well." said the old pioneer
in a tone of voice which vibrates with wonderful vigor even now. "I was born in Quadring in
the Fen country of Lincolnshire, England, on 22nd February, 1835. That was in the reign of
William IV., before Queen Victoria came to the throne. I left London on 3rd December, 1851,
in the ship 'Bentink' 387 tons; the only vessel then bound for Australia. I and two brothers,
One of them had been out to Port Philip, as it was then called, and after about nine months
stay went back to England, working his passage as assistant steward In the ship 'Rodney. After
helping us to get in the harvest, we all sailed for Adelaide. We had very rough weather after
we got into the Bay of Biscay, and a lot of the poultry and other live stock (intended for
food for the cabin passengers and seven intermediate) was lost, so we had to put in to the
Cape of Good Hope for supplies. Whilst there, three of the crew refused to proceed with the
ship, so the captain had to get fresh hands, which delayed us three days. "We had a good run
from there to Adelaide where we arrived on 8th April 1852 126 days from London. We took our
passage from there in the Lady Harvey, one of the vessels trading between Adelaide and Melbourne,
and carrying passengers from Adelaide to the goldfields at Forest Creek. When we arrived at
our destination there was a home provided for us, built by one of our brothers (in the Richmond
flat), three of whom came out in 1850, I was given the job of cook and housekeeper for the
four brothers during the winter, as they intended to go to the diggings at the Spring; but
the news from the goldfields was not so good, so they decided to stay in Melbourne. One of
our brothers got a job as assistant in a draper's shop in Collins street at £3 a week, and
two got a horse and dray each, and carried goods from the wharf to the stores in Melbourne.
One plied a water cart, and I got a billet in a grocery store at 15s a week. When I had earned
enough money I bought a horse and dray, for which I gave £180. and carted on the wharf for
a time, and then took loading to the gold fields; but was unfortunate in having my horses
'planted,' and it cost me £15 to get them. There were men in those early days making money
by taking carriers' horses away from the camps in the night and 'planting' them and waiting
until a reward was offered, and then would bring them to the owners. I sold my horse and dray,
and bought a team of bullocks, and with a shipmate, who also got a team we travelled together
with our teams, carrying to different gold fields until 1861. In 1857 I and three brothers
bought a section of land on the Werribee plains, and carried on dairying and hay growing for
the Melbourne market. In 1876 we heard from Mr. Harkness, a brother of Mr. Chas. Harkness,
about Brandy Creek and three of us drove up in a spring cart to Brandy Creek; put our horses
in Mr. Hans paddock, and carried our swags and food on our backs out to a store and post office
on Lardner's Track, kept by a Mrs. Symes. We thought they were the longest miles (about five)
that we had ever travelled. We stayed the night there, and next day made for the surveyors'
camp, which was on Mr. John Hardie's selection. We wanted five blocks one each for self and
brother and three nephews We borrowed a pocket compass from a man in the camp, and got Mr.
Hardie to go with us, and took axes to blaze the track and cut the scrub in the line we went
(about two and a half miles), and when it was surveyed our line was but three feet out. After
pegging out the land we had to wait until it was granted to us. In the winter of 1877 we had
about 100 acres of scrub cut, costing £1 per acre, and in the following autumn we got it burnt
off, and then had to pick up all the small wood and rubbish and burn it ready for sowing with
grass seed. But before we could get the seed to the place we had to corduroy two boggy flats
about a quarter of a mile altogether, and build two bridges over creeks. It cost about 15s
an acre to pick up and clear the land ready for sowing, and about the same for seed. When
it got ready to stock we put on 600 sheep and soon after we got them shorn. Then the caterpillars
came and eat up all the grass, and left it as bare as if the land had never been sown, so
the sheep had to live on the scrub until we sold them. When the grass came on again in the
autumn we bought some dairy heifers and cows, intending to go in for cheese-making in the
spring, but the caterpillars came and eat up all the grass again, so we had to dry off the
milkers and put all the cattle out to graze. We had the same experience four years following.
Soon after we bought those heifers the pleuro broke out amongst them, and we lost some of
the best of them (we heard afterwards that they came from a herd that was infected with the
disease). We got them inoculated, and after a while got rid of the disease. When the pest
ceased to trouble us we thought it a pity to kill any more timber, and put in a sawmill, and
laid seven miles of tramway in to Darnum station with 60 lb. iron rails bought from the Railway
Commissioners, and we imported a locomotive made by Fowler. of Leeds, England, the whole plant
costing about £6000. We got no assistance from the Railway Department. It was reported in
the 'Argus' that several hundred tons of 50 lb. rails had been sold to go to China at £2 5s
a ton. but the department refused to let us have any 50 lb. rails, and charged us £4 10s a
ton for 60 lb. rails, and when we had finished with them, we had to take £2 5s a ton for them
and pay freight to Melbourne. They might well say that We had been good customers after making
such profit out of us. We were also harassed by land-owners through whose land the tram was
laid. In one case we paid more in rent than twice the amount the owner gave for the whole
block of land. It was poor land, unfenced and unimproved.. After carrying on the sawmill business
for 13 years we came out of it in 1903, poorer than when we began. The reason we left the
Werribee plains was on account of the drought. We used to say, when it came enough rain there,
it rained all over the world". In the year 1866 thousands of cattle and horses were sent from
the plains and Bacchus Marsh to Dandenong to save their lives. "There is no doubt the Cropley
family have obeyed the command to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth. I was
one of a family of 14 (eleven boys and three girls). Four brothers married four sisters, and
had 40 children. Three brothers married three sisters of another family, and had about 20
children. There was no baby bonus or old-age pensions in those days. That law was not made
solely for the benefit of the recipients, but to secure their votes.

PLUMBER SAVED FROM DROWNING
</p><p>
MOE, Thursday.— When bathing in the Narracan Creek at 6 p.m. yesterday,
Percy Cropley, 32, plumber, of Moe, narrowly escaped drowning. But for
prompt action by David Otlenson, formerly a member of the Albert Park Life-Saving Club, he would have lost his life.
Ottenson was walking towards Calder Bridge when he heard a call for help.
He ran back, and, diving, grasped CropIey.
</p><p>
He had the greatest difficulty in landing him on the slippery bank. Two
other swimmers did their best to help him, but they found it hard to avoid
being swept away by the swift current.

<b>Obituary.</b> MRS. G. E. CROPLEY Residents of the district, particularly those at Truganina
and Mt. Cotterell, felt a deep sense of loss upon learning at the past week-end of the death
of Mrs. G. E. Cropley, which occurred at the residence of her daughter, Mrs. H. Fisher, junr.,
Wedge Street, on Saturday afternoon. The late Mrs. Cropley had not enjoyed good health recently,
becoming unwell about eight months ago. She was seriously ill for a week prior to her passing,
which, nevertheless, came as a shock to friends. Mrs. Cropley, who was 62 years of age, was
a native of Mt. Cotterall and lived the whole of her life in the local district. Fewer residents
of Truganina, where her husband engaged in farming activities, were better known than Mr.
and Mrs. Cropley. The remarkably high esteem in which they were held was testimony of the
place they occupied in the affections of the people of the district. Mrs. Cropley was the
possessor of a genial nature and attributes that won for her the warm regard of friends. Mr.
Cropley predeceased his wife about six years ago. Since that time, Mrs. Cropley has resided
in Werribee. Members of the family are George (Laverton), Mrs. W. Wills and Mrs. H. Fisher,
junr., to whom the sympathy of residents is extended. The funeral at the Truganina cemetery
on Monday was largely attended. Coffin-bearers were Messrs. S. Cropley, H. Cropley (nephews),
W. Wills and H. Fisher (sons-in-law), while the pall was supported by friends, and residents
of Truganina acquainted with the late Mrs. Cropley for many years. The service at the graveside
was conducted by the Rev. P. W. ,Turner. Mr. E. W. Jackson, of Williamstown, attended to the
funeral arrangements.

MAN KILLED IN QUARRY Charge Exploded Prematurely MELBOURNE, Thursday. A premature explosion
of a blasting charge at Cropleys quarry, near Laverton, to-day caused a heavy fall of rock,
one piece of which, weighing about four tons, fell on George McCrorey, a quarryman (28), single,
of Trafalgar, killing him instantly. Two other men escaped uninjured. McCrorey was working
about l8ft. below the place where the charge had been inserted in the rock. Jack Dusting,
of Trafalgar, was above on the edge of the open cut, and George Bolton, also of Trafalgar,
was working in the bottom of the quarry when the charge was fired. About 150 tons of rock
was dislodged. Dusting was blown from the top of the quarry, and Bolton was knocked down by
the concussion. McCrorey tripped as he sought safety, and was over whelmed by the falling
rock.

</p><p>
THERE was an air of excitement and anticipation at Darvall Lodge nursing home in Noble Park
this week as residents and staff prepared for a special day.
</p><p>
Led by program manager Nadiya Storojenko, residents, staff and ancillary workers are meticulously
ticking off the calendar in a countdown to August 14 when Edna Braden celebrates her 101st
birthday.
</p><p>
"We have invited Greater Dandenong mayor Youhorn Chea to a party in Edna's honour and we are
hoping he will be a special guest," Mrs Storojenko said.
</p><p>
Mrs Braden has lived at Darvall Lodge for four years, and her husband, Jim, was also a resident
until his death at 99.
</p><p>
She is the youngest of three daughters and a son, whose parents ran a dairy farm in the Warragul
district, and also at Ellinbank in West Gippsland.
</p><p>
Mrs Braden attended primary and high school in Warragul, and later completed a commercial
course at a local convent.
</p><p>
She worked as a legal secretary in a solicitor's office in Warragul and met her husband at
a local dance. Jim, who was a school teacher, taught at schools in the area including a 'one
teacher' school at Lillico.
</p><p>
The Bradens married in the former Warragul Methodist Church in 1937.
</p><p>
When World War II broke out, Mr Braden became a navy instructor and went to sea rated as a
school master.
</p><p>
He was an administrative captain of a number of N-class destroyer flotillas &ndash; British
ships with crews who were mainly Australians.
</p><p>
While her husband was on active service Mrs Braden and their son Donald returned to live with
Mrs Braden's parents until the end of the war.
</p><p>
Mrs Braden is proud of her family: Donald, who is an accountant; her daughter-in-law, Kaye;
two great-grandsons Anthony and Stuart; and two great-granddaughters Charlotte and Amber.
</p><p>
She and Mr Braden had a love of travel especially overseas, and of bowls. They played at the
Hawthorn Bowling Club where they made many friends.
</p><p>
Mrs Braden, who enjoyed knitting, is also admired by her family and friends for her skill
as a cook.
