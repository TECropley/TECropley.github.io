<p>
MAFFRA POLICE COURT. MONDAY Nov. 7th, 1881. (Before A. W. Hewitt, Esq, P.M.)
</p>
<p>
John M‘Innes v. Henry Smyth.--Mr Thomson appeared for plaintiff, Mr Bushe for defendant. Summons
for assault.
</p>
<p>
John M‘Innes, stated that he was a farmer residing at Valencia Creek. On the 20th of Sept.
he went to count some rails that were being split for him; Smyth came up on horseback, said
he intended to thrash him, and thereupon caught him by the throat. The defendant struck him
several times on the face; tried to defend himself; defendant knocked him down, knelt on his
chest, severely bruised his ribs and injured to of his fingers. Plaintiff came to Maffra and
saw Dr. Eccles, who had examined him; had paid £1 1s for doctor's fees and 2s 6d for medicine;
had not given any cause for the assault.
</p>
<p>
Cross-examined by Mr Bushe: Had not been on speaking terms with Smyth for some time past.
Had heard that Smyth intended to thrash him. Had not been talking about having seen his mother's
ghost. It was not a regular stand up fight. Asked the man who was splitting not to let Smyth
kill him. Took off his shirt when he found he was, getting the worst of it, then ran away
about three hundred yards, picking up a small stick, but threw it away.
</p>
<p>
Dr. Eccles deposed that M‘Innes came to him on Oct. 20 for medical advice. He found plaintiffs
face cut in several places, and he complained of a pain in left side. Subsequently found a
bruise on his left shoulder, and left hand swollen, and two fingers contracted. Believed the
wounds on face to be the result of a blow.
</p>
<p>
To Mr Bushe: Could not say for certain how the injuries occurred; they could scarcely have
happened from a fall.
</p>
<p>
C. Metzastene, farmer, deposed he remembered hearing Smyth call M‘Innes names and use insulting
expressions. Saw him strike M‘Innes, who said he did not want to fight. Saw each of the combatants
with sticks in their hands.
</p>
<p>
To Mr Bushe: Was only a few yards off when Smyth came up. Smyth struck M‘Innes first. They
fought several rounds when both took off their shirts. It lasted about a quarter of an hour.
</p>
<p>
To Mr Thomson: The assault was wholly provoked by Smyth.
</p>
<p>
W. J. M‘Innes son of plaintiff; deposed that he knew Smyth. He was coming from school some
time previous to the assault, when Smyth rode up and threatened to break his mouth, and said
he would kill his father.
</p>
<p>
John M‘Innes deposed: He knew plaintiff and defendant for the last 8 or 9 years. Had heard
Smyth say he would draw plaintiff's eyes out. Smyth had said to him that M‘Innes had stated
he had seen the ghost of defendant's mother.
</p>
<p>
To Mr Bushe: Had spoken to M‘Innes about it, and he had heard some old women's tales to that
effect.
</p>
<p>
To Mr Thomson: Smnyth was the first to mention to me about the ghost.
</p>
<p>
This ended the plaintiff's case.
</p>
<p>
Mr Bushe, for the defence, urged that the case was a most trumpery affair. The facts were
that there was an old grudge between them. The plaintiff had made certain remarks relative
to the spiritual condition of defendant's mother, who had been dead and buried some time.
That was very hurtful to his (defendant's) feelings, and he would call a witness to prove
what he stated was correct.
</p>
<p>
Sarah M‘Intyre deposed she was at M‘Innes's farm some time before the fight. Mr and Mrs M‘Innes
were present. Mr M‘Innes stated that he had seen Snyth's mother's ghost, who was in purgatory,
and that the sum of £10 would have to be paid before she could be released.
</p>
<p>
Cross-examined by Mr Thomson: This conversation took place about 6 months ago; had not mentioned
the conversation to anyone.
</p>
<p>
The bench fined defendant 20s, and 13s costs.
</p>
<p>
Michael Smyth, for using threatening words towards J. M‘Innes, was bound over to keep the
peace for 6 months in his own recognisance in £25.
</p>
<p>
A similar information was sworn against Wm. Russell by J. M‘Innes, but, was dismissed.

<p>
ASSAULT: William J. M‘Innes v. J. Diver, jun. Assault at Wadelock on 7th July 1894. Defendant
did not appear. From evidence given by plaintiff and another witness it appears that M‘Innes
left the Mechanics Institute, Wadelock, on the night in question, and proceeded housewards
in company with a young woman. Before they had gone far, Diver came up, caught hold of him,
and struck him, besides using bad language. The plaintiff could give no explanation of the
assault. Diver came to him next morning, and challenged him to fight.
</p>
<p>
The P.M. said the assault was a most unwarrantable one, and he was determined to suppress
such behaviour, so he would inflict a fine of £2. with £2 16s costs, in default 14 days imprisonment.

wore a, charming gown of white silk, trimmed with Valenciennes lace and insertion, and carried
a bouquet with white streamers. The bridesmaids (sisters of the bride) wore white silk, trimmed
with white Valenciennes lace and insertion and colored sashes. Miss Maggie M‘Innes carried
a bouquet of white and pink flowers, with pink streamers, while Miss Ada M‘Innes bore one

MAFFRA SHOOTING CASE. McINNES COMMITTED FOR TRIAL. Hector M‘Innes was charged at the Maffra
Court on Friday, before Messrs Horstman, Price and J. J. Linton, J's.P., with having, on July
9, "feloniously, unlawfully and maliciously shot at Charles Bryant with intent to do grievous
bodily harm." Superintendent Cawsey prosecuted, and Mr A. F. Rice defended accused.
</p>
<p>
Charles Bryant said that accused was his son-in-law. The couple had not been living on the
best of terms. Witness visited their house on the day in question, and interviewed his daughter.
M‘Innes had a pocket-knife in his hand, and he said that he would stick witness to the heart
with it. Bryant's wife afterwards drove up, and M‘Innes's wife went away with her to witness's
place, four miles out of Maffra. M‘Innes came out on the same afternoon, and asked if his
wife was there. Witness went to the door, and Mclnnes had the knife in his hand again. Bryant
picked up a broom, followed him out, and told him to get off the premises. McInnes then rushed
to the gate and picked up a gun, whereupon Bryant ran away. When about 20 yards away he heard
a report. He was shot in the calf of his leg. Witness ran away to a neighbour's place, and
was taken to the hospital at Maffra.
</p>
<p>
Under cross examination Bryant said that on visiting McInnes's house he had "a bit of a row."
He carried his whip into the house. He would not swear that Mclnnes had tobacco in his hands,
but was sure that he had a knife. When McInnes came out to his place he (McInnes) again had
a knife in his hand.
</p>
<p>
Mrs Kincaid gave evidence to the effect that accused called at her place in Maffra on the
afternoon in question, and asked for the loan of a gun. She asked him why he wanted it, and
McInnes said, "They have taken my wife and child away, and I will shoot Bryant if he does
not let my wife and child come back to me."
</p>
<p>
After other evidence had been given accused, who pleaded not guilty and reserved his defence,
was committed for trial at the Warragul Sessions on 18th August. Bail was allowed in his own
recognisance for £100, and two other sureties for £50. Bail was forthcoming,

A FAMILY QUARREL LEADS TO SERIOUS RESULTS. CHARGE OF MALICIOUS WOUNDING.
</p>
<p>
Before His Honor Judge Moule and a jury of 12 at the Warragul Court of General Sessions on
Thursday, Hector M‘Innes was charged on two counts with shooting with intent to do grievous
bodily harm, and with wounding with intent to do grievously bodily harm, his father-in-law,
Charles Bryant, The parties reside near Maffra.
</p>
<p>
Mr Leon prosecuted for the Crown, and Mr Maxwell (instructed by Mr A. F. Rice) appeared for
accused.
</p>
<p>
Mr Leon set out the facts of the case, and called Charles Bryant, who appeared on crutches,
and gave his evidence from a seat in the body of the court.
</p>
<p>
Evidence was given by witness similar to that taken at the lower Court.
</p>
<p>
Mr Maxwell called no witnesses for the defence, but made a powerful address to the jury, pleading
that though accused was undoubtedly guilty of unlawfully wounding Bryant, there was no evidence
of intention of doing him grievously bodily harm. As accused said to the constable, he had
only fired to frighten him, though he could easily have shot him had he so desired.
</p>
<p>
After a retirement of 10 minutes the jury found accused guilty of unlawfully wounding with
no malicious intent.
</p>
<p>
Mr Maxwell asked that prisoner be allowed out on recognisances.
</p>
<p>
His Honor said he felt inclined, in the interests of the community, to pass a severe sentence,
but having regard to the fact that accused had promised to give up drink, and leniency might
be the means of bringing husband and wife together, he would take the course asked for by
Mr Maxwell. He supposed prisoner would make some reparation to Mr Bryant for the bodily injury
he had suffered.
</p>
<p>
Mr Maxwell: Oh, yes.
</p>
<p>
His Honor then severely lectured accused and passed a sentence of 2 years and 9 months on
him, but suspended sentence on accused father entering into a bond of £100 and accused himself
in a sum of £50 for his good behaviour during that term. — "Guardian"

DEATH OF MRS. ANNIE McINNES
</p>
<p>
Pioneer of Gippsland Passes Away At Bairnsdale
</p>
<p>
With the death at Dahlsendale Private Hospital, Bairnsdale, on Monday last of Mrs. Annie McInnes,
widow of the late Mr. Donald McInnes, formerly of Little Plain, near Valencia, Gippsland has
lost another of her early pioneers.
</p>
<p>
Born in the beautiful Huon district of Tasmania 88 years ago, the late Mrs. McInnes came to
Victoria when seven years of age and was educated at Gisborne, where she stayed with her uncle,
the late Mr. Edward Cherry, a name well-known in the development of scientific farming. After
completing her education Mrs. Mclnnes returned to Tasmania where she was married to the late
Mr. Donald McInnes, who had acquired land at Little Plain. The newly married couple travelled
by boat from Tasmania to Port Albert and then by coach to Sale. In those days the means of
transport were very primitive, and the next stage of the journey to Little Plain had to be
undertaken on horse-back. Mrs. McInnes was an intrepid horsewoman, with a stout heart and
a noble character. She opened a school in her own home for the children of the district, and
this beneficent work was carried on until the Education Department erected a school building
in the locality. The Department asked her to continue her teaching work, but owing to having
the responsibility of a young family Mrs. McInnes was reluctantly compelled to decline.
</p>
<p>
The late Mrs. McInnes resided in the Maffra district for about 67 years, but for many years
past she had lived with her daughter at Merangba House, Lakes Entrance, except for brief periods
when she stayed on a property which she owned at Korumburra. She is survived by two son and
four daughters, namely, Mr. N. W. McInnes, J.P. (Tinamba), Mr. F. H. McInnes, J.P. (Outtrim),
Mrs. White (Nilma), Mrs. Garth (Nambrok). Mrs. Turnbull (New Zealand), Miss E. M. McInnes
(Lakes Entrance). Another son, Mr. Michael McInnes of Nambrok, died a few years ago.
