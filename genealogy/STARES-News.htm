<b>Death </b>STARES-On the 29th ult., at the residence of his grand parents, Nicholson street,
Bairnsdale, Frederick Victor Stares, aged 3 months and 2 weeks. A little angel gone to rest.

Bairnsdale Advertiser and Tambo and Omeo Chronicle, Tuesday 5 August 1890
</h3><p>
Mr George Stares, a very old resident of Bairnsdale, and who was at one time owner of the
steamer Lady of the Lake, has been missing since Monday week from Cuninghame, at which place
he was employed. It would appear that he was in the habit of sculling across the river in
a boat to the jetty at the Lakes Entrance works on arrival of the steamer from Bairnsdale,
and it is generally supposed that in doing so he has been carried out to sea by the current.
Every search has been made about the lakes in the Government launch, and along the Ninety
Mile Bench by the steamer Mystery, but no tidings can be found of the missing man.
</p><h3>
Gippsland Times, Monday 4 August 1890
</h3><p>
A case of mysterious disappearance is reported from Cunninghame, at the Lakes entrance. A
man named George Stares, who has for some time been engaged as watchman on the dredge working
at the entrance, has been missing since yesterday week. He lived by himself on Bullock Island.
On Monday afternoon he informed Mrs Dwyer, living close by, that he was going next day to
Bairnsdale for medical advice. He has been suffering from severe cold. Since then nothing
has been heard or seen of him. The Government boat, with sculls, is also missing. The belief
is that Stares, who has lost three fingers of his left hand, and, therefore, is unable to
row, started to scull from the island to the mainland, when he was caught by the outflow and
carried through the entrance to sea. The Government steamer Mystery went down on Friday and
searched the lake coasts for several miles, but found no trace. Other parties are out and
great anxiety is felt. Stares, who was a splendid swimmer, was an old man-of-war's man, and
part owner and master of the well-known steamer Lady of the Lake. Of course, possibly, he
may have, if carried to sea, been picked up by some passing intercolonial vessel. Three years
since he had a narrow escape of drowning in the Mitchell. He fell over board from the steamer
Lady of the Lake, but was rescued by Constable Costello. Stares family reside at Bairnsdale,
and are highly respected.

MELBOURNE. Friday Night. Cliffy Island lighthouse is displaying signals intimating that there
is a wreck or that some one is in distress. It is thought possible that the signals may refer
to the man Stares, who is missing from Bullock Island, near the Entrance.

The dreaded typhoid has made its appearance in Bairnsdale, and we regret to have to announce
the death of Mrs Fred. Kreymborg. The disease was of a malignant type. The patient had the
advantage of good nursing, which is almost everything in typhoid, by Nurse Macleod, who came
up from Melbourne for that purpose. It is fortunately nothing more than an isolated case.
Bairnsdale is very free this season from typhoid, still it is no harm to bear in mind the
hygienic laws which have the most influence upon this disease.</p>
<br/>
<p>Funeral Notice. THE friends of Mr F. KREYMBORG are respectfully invited to follow the remains
of his late beloved WIFE to their last resting place, the Bairnsdale General Cemetery. The
funeral will move from his residence, McMillan street, THIS (TUESDAY) afternoon, at 2 o'clock.
JAMES TAYLOR. Undertaker.

Mr Thomas Stares, residing at Longford, was bitten by a snake on Friday night. Very late in
the evening he went outside to feed his horses, and while doing so felt a smart prick near
the foot. He struck a match and on looking down saw a snake entwined round his leg. With difficulty
he kicked the reptile off, but not before it had injected into him a good dose of poison.
A ligature was at once applied, and he was brought into Sale. One of his sons sensibly rode
in ahead of him, so that when his father arrived Dr. Hagenauer was waiting ready to attend
to him. On Saturday morning Mr Stares did not seem to be improving, and Dr. Hagenauer ordered
him to the Gippsland Hospital. He spent a sleepless night on Saturday night, but will probably
be able to leave the institution to-day.

BITTEN BY A SNAKE. Sale, 7th March. Another case of snakebite occurred near here last night.
Mr. Thomas Stares, a middle-aged man, who resides at Longford, went out in the dark to feed

to the institution, and his condition is regarded as serious. Several cases of snakebite have
occurred here recently, and in one case the victim died.

A miner named Arthur Rogers was accidentally killed at the New Dempsey's mine today. 
Rogers was working in the shaft, and a new bucket was to be put in the

A man named Henry Thomas Stares, 51 years of age, a resident of Longford, was carting rails
in that district on Saturday, when he was bitten on the left arm by a tiger snake. He scarified
the wound and sucked it, and was brought into the Gippsland Hospital, where he is progressing

In December last, on a Saturday afternoon, in Raymond-street, Sale, Henry
Thomas Stares was knocked down ly the Sale Butter Factory Company's cart
and had a rib broken and other injuries. On Thursday, at the Sale County Court,
he sued the company, claiming £25 damages, alleging that the accident was
due to the negligence of the driver of the cart, Michael Shallue. Mr Ormered
appeared for plaintiff and Mr. Wise for defendant. The plaintiff's case was that
Stares was crossing Raymond-street in front of Brennan's office to meet Charles
Shields, whom he called, and that he (Stares) stood in the road for about a
minute. The roadway was clear as he crossed, and Shallue, who was, driving
at about four miles an hour, ran into him. The shaft of the cart struck Stares
in the back and Dr. Mlacdonald, Junr., who attended to him, found one of his
ribs broken. C. Shields, J. C. Brennan and W. P. Brennan were witnesses for
plaintiff, and Shallue and Frank Manning for the defence. They deposed that
Shallue pulled aside to let a buggy pass and could nut have seen Stares until he
was right on him. His Honor found that the driver of the cart was 
negligent in not looking where he was going, and gave a verdict for £20 and costs, to be taxed.

Reporter (Box Hill), Friday 28 April 1911

Claim for Maintenance. Ida May Bright sued her husband, Frederick Charles Bright, for maintenance.
Mr. Newnan appeared for the complainant, and Mr. L. J. Hall for defendant. Ida May Bright
said that she was married to the defendant on May 1, 1908, and they had lived until recently
at Rutlasid road, Box Hill. Witness was now living with friends in Camberwell. Her husband
had never hit her, but had continually accused her of unchastity. She had never been out with
other men, and had not committed adultery with any man. She had assisted in maintaining the
home by washing and canvassing. On February 17 last her husband came home between 4 and 5
p.m. Witness was lying down in her room, and hearing her husband at the back door she went
out and met him in the dining room. He asked her whom she had in her bedroom, and she replied
that she had no one. Her husband then went into the bedroom and said that there was a man
under the bed. Witness went into the room, and there was no one there. Her husband said the
man went out through the window; she did not have a man in the room at all. Her husband was
white with rage, and threatened to &quot;do for&quot; her if she did not leave the house.
She thought he would carry out his threat, and that was why she left. As her husband went
out he met a Mrs. Treble at the gate, and told her that witness had had a man under the bed.
Her husband was now boarding with Mrs. Treble, who was at one time a close friend of witness.
Since that day defendant had not given her any money, and she had written to him, asking him
what provision he was going to make for her, and signing the letter &quot;your unfaithful
wife.&quot; Her husband wrote arranging to meet her at Mr. Hall's office and at his (Mr. Hall)
house, but he did not keep either appointment. For the defence Frederick Charles Bright said
that since his marriage he had lived happily with his wife, until the beginning of this year.
He had never accused her of being untrue to him; he did not suspect anything until he found
the man, in the house on February 17. On that day he was passing the house in the cart, and
called in to give his wife his wages. He went around to the back; the kitchen was empty, the
fire was out, and there was a pan of tomatoes in the fireplace. He walked to the bedroom,
the door of which opened, disclosing his wife's face, and shut again. Then the door opened
wide, and his wife came out, pressing him back into the dining room. Witness gave her his
wages, and she then went out to the yard to got some firewood. While his wife was outside
he had an uneasy feeling that there was someone in the house. He went into the bedroom, and
stooping down discovered a man named Joe Ainger under the bed. Witness cursed and swore at
Ainger for some time, calling him all the names he could lay his tongue to. Ainger did not
reply, but kept his hand over his face. He had known Ainger for 20 years—ever since he had
lived in Box Hill, and had no hesitation in saying that he was the man. Witness did not attempt
to lay his hand on Ainger. He returned to the kitchen and met his wife who denied that there
was a man in the bedroom, and when they went to the room he had disappeared. At this point
Mrs.. Treble appeared at the gate, and witness went out and told her what had occurred. His
wife said: &quot;That's a lie; don't believe it,&quot; but subsequently she said: &quot;I
admit a man was there; he's a better man than you, and he's got more money.&quot; Witness
said : &quot;&quot;In that case you clear out before 5 o'clock, or else I'll kill you.&quot;
He then went back to work, and when he returned his wife was gone. Witness next saw his wife,
on March 18, when she came to the house and asked for a, photograph. He refused to give it
to her, and he called Mrs. Treble in and asked her to remain as a witness to what his wife
said. Then they scandalised one another, and his wife said: &quot;I admit that these was a
man under the bed, and he's a better man than you—&quot; Witness said: &quot;In that case
let him keep you.&quot; He later on received a letter signed &quot;Brother&quot;; he would
swear it was in his wife's handwriting. Mrs. Daisy Treble said she had known the Brights for
eighteen months. On February 17 she was visiting their house and met Mr. Bright at the gate.
He was very excited, and told witness lie had found a man under the bed. Mrs. Bright came
out and said: &quot;There was a man under the bed, and he's a better man than you; he's got
more money than you.&quot; Mr. Bright said: &quot;If that's the case, let him keep you; if
you don't get out of the house before I come home I'll do for you.&quot; Mrs. Bright had admitted
to witness that she had been out with other men, and when witness told her husband he said
she must break off the friendship. Mrs. Bright also admitted to witness that she had misconducted
herself with a man in the Box Hill cemetery. Since Christmas Mrs. Bright had been at witness's
house three nights a week. Alice Treble, a sister-in-law of the last witness, gave, corroborative
evidence regarding Mrs. Bright's admissions. …(illegible)… Defendant would be ordered to pay
his wife 10/ a week, and find one surety of £25, in default one month's imprisonmente, with
£2 2/ costs. Mr. Brooke said that he dissented altogether from the decision. He had come to
the conclusion that Mrs. Bright had committed adultery, and that defendant could not be compelled
to maintain her. Mr. Hall gave notice of his intention to appeal against the decision.

NOVEL DEFENCE SUCCEEDS.

Clement Thomas Stares, proprietor of a bicycle shop, was charged at the
Maffra Court with having driven an unregistered motor-car, and with having 
driven a motor-car without an identifying number affixed. Mr. C. P. Semmnens, 
solicitor, who defended, said the facts were undisputed regarding the first 
charge, but he submitted that a motor-car which was not
registered could not have an identifying number. Instead of being an offence 
for not having a number affixed, it should be an offence to
have a number of an unregistered car. For an unregistered car
there was no prescribed number. Mr. Bond, P.M., said that he and his colleagues 
thought that there was something in the contention. The police
withdrew the second charge and Stare was fined £1 on the first charge.

LARCENY CHARGE FAILS AGAINST LONGFORD MOTORIST
</p><p>
Borrowed Red Lamp from Roadside
</p><p>
Proceeding towards Bairnsdale from Swift's Creek on the evening of November 23 last, Leslie
Thomas Stares, transport driver of Longford, experienced a breakdown of his borrowed motor 
truck and while repairing it on the roadside found also that the tail light would not operate. 
In the interests of safety, he replaced it with a red lantern taken from a nearby C.R.B. danger sign.
</p><p>
As a result he appeared on Tuesday before Mr Elvish, 
S.M. at Bairnsdale Court, charged with larceny of the 
lantern, valued at £1/1/, from the Country Roads
Board and with having driven in Main Street, Bairnsdale 
without a rear light on his motor vehicle. 
</p><p>
After consideration, Mr Elvish said, that he was not 
convinced, that Stares, for whom Mr Engel appeared, 
had intended larceny of the lamp and dismissed the
charge, but fined him £2 for having no rear light.
</p><p>
After Stares had pleaded not guilty to the larceny 
charge and guilty to that of not having a rear light, 
Andrew Buchanan CRB. patrolman gave evidence that on
that afternoon of November 23rd he had hung a number
of groups of traffic lanterns at points on the Omeo 
highway between Sarsfield and Bruthen, where danger was
caused by road repairs. Next morning he found one of the
lanterns missing.
</p><p>
Constable Alfred Fletcher, of Bairisdale, told the court
that at 8.20 p.m. on Novem driving a motor vehicle without 
a tail light in Main St. Bairnsdale. On inspection he
found a red CRB lantern attached to the rear, but not
ther this nor the fixed tail light was illuminated.
</p><p>
When asked where he obtained the CRB lantern
Stares at first claimed that he got it from a "CRB chap"
but was unable to give his name or description. Later,
at the Bairnsdale police station he admitted having taken 
the lantern from a board at the side of the road about
six miles from Bruthen.
</p><p>
When asked what he intended to do with the lantern 
Stares said that he planned to throw it away,
the witness declared.
</p><p>
Senior Constable Carl F. W. Pepper, of Bairnsdale,
corroborated the previous evidence.
</p><p>
In the witness box Stares explained that he spent half
an hour on the roadside when the borrowed truck
broke down near Bruthen. At this time he discovered
that the tail light would not operate, so in the interests
of safety he took a CRB lantern from among several
others on a roadside board and attached it, lighted, to
the rear of the vehicle. When repairs were effected he 
continued into Bairnsdale where he was apprehended by 
Constable Fletcher, who pointed out that the lantern had gone
out.
</p><p>
Stares denied that he had said that he intended to
throw the lantern away, and assured the court that it
had always been his intention to return it to the board.
He said also that he had no recollection of having told
Constable Fletcher that he got the lantern from a "CRB chap."
</p><p>
Mr Engel then claimed that evidence was against
the suggestion that Stares had been guilty of larceny,
which he defined as a desire to deprive an owner permanently 
of his goods.
</p><p>
The magistrate, after pointing out the conflict of
evidence as to what Stares intended, eventually to do
with the lantern, said that he was not convinced that
larceny was intended and that the defendant was entitled 
to the benefit of the doubt.
</p><p>
He dismissed the larceny charge, but fined Stares £2,
in default distress, on the other charge.
</p><p>
Senior Constable E. L. Howlett conducted the prosecution.-"Advertiser"

Partner of Victorian pilot witnessed crash that claimed his life
</h3><p>
July 08, 2015: An 85-year-old man has died in a light plane crash near Geelong.
</p><p>
The partner of an elderly pilot, who died in a light plane crash in Lethbridge, west of Melbourne today, 
saw the entire tragic incident.
</p><p>
Ron Stares' devastated partner watched as the aircraft nosedived shortly after take-off from Lethbridge Airport.
</p><p>
The 85-year-old was taking off on a joyride just before midday when his kit-built Sonnex aircraft slammed back 
to earth as his partner of 15 years watched on from the airport's hangar.
</p><p>
The plane was around six metres from the ground when it crashed.
</p><p>
The only damage to the plane was to the nose.
</p><p>
Witnesses told 9NEWS the plane got about 10 metres off the ground immediately after take-off before it started 
to move erratically and then crashed from a height of about six metres.
</p><p>
Airport owner Garry Baum rushed to help and began resuscitation on the elderly man.
</p><p>
"He'd taken off down the runway and only got about a quarter of the way down the runway and something hasn't been 
right," he said.
</p><p>
"(His partner) is absolutely devastated, but she's got some satisfaction Ron was doing what he loved doing."
</p><p>
The pilot had died before rescuers were able to revive him.
</p><p>
An investigation will determine the cause of the crash.
</p><p>
One witness, a doctor, reported seeing the pilot slumped at the controls moments before the crash.
</p><p>
Other witnesses said they thought the impact of the crash was so minimal they expected to see the pilot climb 
out of the cockpit and walk away with cuts and bruises.
</p><p>
The aircraft was left almost intact except for damage to its nose.
</p><p>
Members of the flying club have been left shaken by the incident and said Mr Stares was a competent pilot who 
had recently passed his bi-annual flying tests.
</p><p>
The pilot's partner witnessed the fatal crash.
</p><p>
An investigation will determine whether the cause was engine failure or an existing medical condition.
</p><p>
Recreational Aviation Australia will assist with the investigation.
