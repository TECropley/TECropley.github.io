<p>CORRESPONDENCE,</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Gipps Land Guardian.</p>
<p>Sale, 17th January, 1859.</p>
<p>"It is not only the right but the duty of every British subject to watch closely the administration of justice."
—-Vide the late Duke of Wellington's speech in the House of Lords. </p>
<p>Sir,—It has always been an Englishman's privilege to grumble and petition to get his grievances redressed—and, 
being one of Scotia's sons, I suppose I may lay some claim to the right of a British subject of complaining 
(through the medium of the Press) of what I consider to have been an act of gross injustice.</p>
<p>I have been for the last two months busily employed in fencing in a portion of my land, (about one hundred and twenty acres,) 
but, in consequence of my harvest coming in upon me rather soon, and, at the same time, being short of hands, 
I was obliged to discontinue my fence, and with the consent of my nearest neighbors, erected a temporary gateway 
until after harvest, when I intended to complete my side line and remove the gate: but I soon found that this 
trifling concession would on no account whatever be tolerated, no matter how short the time, as I directly 
received instructions (through Sergeant Coleman) from the resident magistrate, J. L. M. Carey, Esq., 
to remove the slip panel—which I immediately complied with. </p>
<p>Now, Sir, I do consider, in the present instance, that a most invidious distinction has been made, 
inasmuch as other parties, viz. Messrs. R. &. W. Thompson, W. Montgomery. J. Foster,. and many others, 
had been allowed, for a considerable time prior to this, to place slip panels across various roadways, 
and still to continue the same: and also the well-known fact that, ever since the completion of the 
river Thompson bridge, a gateway has been placed across the roadway at the end of the bridge, 
allowed to remain without any notice whatever having been taken.</p>
<p>Now, I am at a loss to consider why I should have been selected as a solitary example, 
unless it be that, not having the honor to be one of the aristocracy, or a squatter, 
they would wish to fulfil the old adage in trying to crush or smother the working bee 
whilst the drones are allowed to escape unmolested meanwhile.</p>
<p>I most humbly subscribe myself JOHN McCULLUM WILSON,</p>
<p>Square Forest. </p>



<h3>Gippsland Guardian (Vic.) Friday 1 April 1859 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>Sale, Gipps Land
</p>
<p>15th March, 1859.</p>
<p>To J. L. M. Carey, Esq., R.M.</p>
<p>Sir,— It is now upwards of three months since I was requested by your orders to remove the
slip-panel gateways adjoining my, land, which request I immediately complied with, fully expecting
that other parties would have to remove, the like obstructions also: but I have since found
out that I was laboring under a delusion, and am led to believe that there exists two laws—one
for the rich and the other for the working man—and that the good old English adage of that,
which is sauce fur the goose is sauce for the gander does not hold good at Sale, or rather
&quot;Sold-town,&quot; where it appears that parties are liable to be bought and sold as caprice
may dictate.</p>
<p>In conclusion I would advise those parties whose duty it ought to concern to take some steps
in the above matter alluded to, in order to prevent any future unpleasant circumstances— as
I do not intend tacitly to he selected, as a solitary example.
</p>
<p>JOHN McCALLUM WILSON,</p>

<p>MARRIAGE On the 11th inst., under special license by the Rev. James O'Kean, at the residence
of the bride, James, eldest son of Robert Hargrave, Esq., Monaghan, Ireland, to Janet, eldest
daughter of John McCallum Wilson, Esq., Rose Forest, near Sale.</p>

<p>SALE COUNTY COURT. THURSDAY, MAY 22. (Before His Honour Judge Nolan.) JURY CASES.</p>
<p>.... John M'Callum Wilson, who claimed to be the oldest farmer in the district, recollected
that early in January defendant paid him a visit about threshing, but no agreement was arrived
at respecting price. Defendant mentioned that he had to thresh Lyon's peas. Saw Lyon's crop,
and had experience of threshing; considered a large machine like defendant's ought to thresh
from 15 to 20 acres a day. It threshed 55 acres of wheat, eats, and barley in two days after
it left Lyon's. ....</p>

<p>SALE POLICE COURT. TUESDAY, MARCH 18TH. (Before Messrs Johnstone and Mackintosh, J's.P.)</p>
<p>WILFUL ASSAULT. Mary McCallum Wilson proceeded against Mary J. Cullen for wilful assault.</p>
<p>Mr. Staveley appeared for the complainant, and Mr. Mills for the defendant.</p>
<p>The evidence of the complainant,
who is a married woman residing at Rose Forest, was to the effect that on Wednesday, the 12th
inst., she had occasion to visit one of her houses in Stawell Street, Sale. On coming out
of the right of way adjoining the house, Mrs. Cullen without the slightest provocation threw
a bucket of filth over her.</p>
<p>To Mr. Mills: Defendant (who lives in the house adjoining) came
out of her back door and met plaintiff.</p>
<p>This was the case for the complainant, and Mr. Mills
for the defence urged that the alleged wilful assault was most likely a pure accident on the
part of Mrs. Cullen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cullen summoned Mrs. Wilson for using insulting words to her in
a public place, on a day previous to the assault, and the bench decided to hear this case
before giving their decision in the first one.</p>
<p>Mrs. Cullen deposed that, on the morning of
the 11th inst., Mrs. Wilson stood in her right of way in Stawell street. Almost immediately
after she walked out on to the street, and commenced abusing her. Defendant called witness
a rogue, a thief, and a vagabond, and accused her of keeping a bad house.</p>
<p>To Mr. Staveley: Mrs. Wilson complained to me that I was the cause of tenants leaving her house. I did tell
one man that the house might be empty for a long time, as people did not care to live in it.
I threw some timber over Mrs. Wilson's fence because she said that it belonged to her. My
children had been given some of the pieces of timber by the carpenter who was working at defendant's.
At one time I gave Mrs. Wilson a hot dinner every day. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Re-examined by Mr. Mills: This was not the first time Mrs. Wilson abused me. She had done so many a score of times before.</p>
<p>Mr. Staveley: That will do.</p>
<p>Witness (indignantly): You don't like to hear anything said against
her. I am going to tell the truth; not like her, stand up here and tell lies.</p>
<p>Sarah Ann Davis deposed that on the 11th inst. she heard Mrs. Wilson talking opposite Mrs. Cullen's house,
but she could not understand what she was saying.</p>
<p>Mary Carter deposed that she remembered seeing Mrs. Wilson in Stawell Street on the 11th inst. She heard her call Mrs. Cullen a thief,
and she also heard her say that she was a bad woman and kept a bad house.</p>
<p>To Mr. Staveley: I was at my table ironing at the time. Mrs. Wilson called Mrs. Cullen everything but a lady,
and if you want to know any more than I have said already I will tell you.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnstone said that in the case of Mary Wilson against Mary Cullen the bench were satisfied that an assault
had been committed, and fined defendant 5s. in default 24 hours, and to pay the costs. In
the case of Mary Cullen against Mary Wilson the bench fined Mrs. Wilson 5s in default 24 hours,
and to pay costs.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Friday 18 April 1890 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>BREACH OF THE HEALTH ACT.</p>
<p>Constable Noble proceeded against Mary McCallum Wilson for depositing
night soil on certain land within the Borough of Sale other than a place authorised for that
purpose.</p>
<p>Mr Patten, who appeared for the complainant, said that the defendant was charged
under the 35th section of the Health Act, 1889, which provided that any person guilty of the
offence defendant was charged with was liable to a penalty of not less than £5, and not more
than £50.</p>
<p>A little girl named Lily Hobson gave evidence that defendant deposited the night
soil during the day time on her own land in Stawell-street.</p>
<p>Mary Jane Cullen deposed that
on the 22nd of March she was on the woodheap watching defendant spreading poison for witness'
fowls. The nightsoil was subsequently carried out, and the smell was so offensive that witness
had to close her hack door.</p>
<p>C. R. Geoghegan, town clerk, gave evidence that Stawell-street
was not a place authorised to deposit nightsoil.</p>
<p>This was the case for the complainant.</p>
<p>Defendant admitted the offence, but asked why the police issued a summons.</p>
<p>Mr. Little: Simply because they are compelled by law.</p>
<p>Defendant was willing to pay taxes to support police, but she did
not approve of them working up a trifling case like this so as to increase their salaries.
By all means let the police be honored and respected.</p>
<p>Mr. Little to defendant: We are not here to make law, but to administer it. We are allowed to fine you, for the offence you have
confessed to, as much as £50.</p>
<p>Defendant: Why so.</p>
<p>Mr. Little: You have confessed you have done it, and the smallest fine is £5.</p>
<p>Defendant was then fined £5, with £1 3s 6d costs.</p>
<p>Defendant: Am I fined £5? Policemen &quot;run up&quot; a case for a mere nothing. They ought to be ashamed
of themselves, and the people ought to be cautioned against them. Defendant was 47 years in
the colony, and 30 of that an employer.</p>

of Rose Forest, aged 47 years.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 7 August 1893 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>DETERMINED SUICIDE NEAR SALE.</p>
<p>News reached Sale early on Friday morning that the body of a
man had been found in a paddock at The Heart, about three miles from Sale. The police at once
proceeded to the locality and found Robert Wilson lying covered with blood, and his throat
cut from ear to ear. Deceased's people are very old residents of Gippsland. No reason can
be assigned for the suicide, for such it undoubtedly was, as the man was in a very good position,
as well as being of very steady habits. His father died during the last few weeks, and since
then the son had been at times very despondent and melancholy.</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the hospital on Friday afternoon before Mr. Cresswell, P.M., and a jury of seven, the foreman
being Mr. Chas. McLean. The particulars are—</p>
<p>John Wilson, brother of deceased, deposed: I am
a grazier, residing at Square Forest. about two miles from Sale. Deceased is my brother, who
had been staying at Square Forest for the last two or three weeks. Previous to that he resided
at Newry, Upper Maffra, where he had some landed property. Last saw him on Thursday evening
at 7 o'clock at my late father's residence. He had tea with me, and remained for close upon
two hours afterwards. I saw him leave the kitchen where we were sitting. He left and said
&quot;good night, I'm going to bed.&quot; About 8 o'clock I went to his room, and found he
was not there; nor had he been to bed. I didn't take much notice of that, as I thought perhaps
he came down town. He was strange in his manner, and had been that way for five or six weeks,
before and since the death of my father. He was perfectly able to take care of himself, but
he appeared to be melancholy, always sitting down, and not saying anything. He did not behave
as usual. He complained of headache at times, but he did not have any medical attendance.
I know of no reason why he should destroy himself. I am not aware that he was in any way involved
pecuniarily. He never mentioned anything to me about whether he was dissatisfied with my father's
will. He drank very little. The knife produced is my deceased brother's. The writing on the
envelope produced, addressed to Fred Wilson, is not my deceased brother's writing. Deceased's
age was about 47.</p>
<p>The foreman: Did he ever express dissatisfaction about anything at all.</p>
<p>Witness: No.</p>
<p>The foreman: He never made an attempt of this kind before.</p>
<p>Witness: No.</p>
<p>To the coroner: I believe he was a single man.</p>
<p>Frederick Wilson deposed: I am a laborer, residing
at Upper Maffra, where deceased lived. Deceased is my brother Robert, who left Newry to come
to Sale about three weeks ago, to my late father's residence at Square Forest. I never noticed
anything strange, beyond that the bank at Maffra, where his money was locked up, seemed to
trouble him. His general behaviour was the same. He was satisfied with the way he was provided
for in my father's will. He told me that last Sunday. That was the last time I saw him alive.
He was then at Square Forest. I parted from him there, and he promised to return to Upper
Maffra on the Tuesday. The writing on the envelope (produced) I believe to be my deceased
brother's. It is addressed to me, and is not in his usual hand writing. He sometimes altered
it. (Witness opened the letter and found it was not his brother's writing) Deceased's writing
was deceiving sometimes. I know of no reason why my brother should have taken his own life.
He was a single man. and 47 years of age.</p>
<p>The foreman: Did you notice, prior to his death, any seeming alteration in his manner?</p>
<p>Witness: No.</p>
<p>Martin Daffy deposed: I carry the mail from Sale to the Heart and Clydebank. At quarter past 8 on Friday morning, I was riding along
the Heart road, and noticed an object lying in the paddock about 50 yards from the fence.
I went over, and found it was a man, who was dead. It was the deceased, whose body I have
seen. I noticed his hands and face were covered with blood, which had dried. Then went away,
as I had to go on with the mail. Met Mr. Trewin, who was on his way to Sale, and told him
to tell the police that there was a man dead. He just arrived at the place when I was leaving.
Mr. Trewin went straight away to Sale.</p>
<p>Constable Curtain deposed: About 9 o'clock on Friday
morning, I, in company with Sergeant McGann, proceeded to the Heart paddock, about 3 miles
from Sale. Saw the body of deceased, which was lying partly on the side, and part of his face
downwards. The left hand was lying by his left side, the fist being clenched, and covered
with blood. His hat was lying by his head, and a quantity of blood underneath it. On turning
deceased over on his back, I noticed he had his right hand closed, and a knife, with the blade
open, in it. The knife produced is the same. I also noticed in his neck there were two very
large wounds, and his clothes were all covered with blood. The distance from where the body
was and his late father's place was between three and four miles. Searched the body and found
his watch and chain. The watch was still going. There was also a cheque book, and envelope,
produced.</p>
<p>Dr. Browne deposed: I made a post mortem of deceased. The body was that of a healthy
man, between 40 and 50 years of age, well nourished. There were no marks of violence, with
the exception of two wounds in his throat. Should say he had been dead about 12 hours. He
had a clasp knife in his right hand, and his arm was flexed; his left arm was also bent. There
were no cuts or marks, but blood on his hand. On the left side of his neck there was a jigged
wound, about 3 inches long, extending from about an inch below the angle of his jaw, downwards
towards the notch in his breast bone, dividing the skin, superficial muscles, and severing
the external jugular vein and small arteries. The bottom of the wound, the windpipe, was partially
severed below the thyroid gland. The second wound, also jagged, commenced half an inch on
the left side of the same gland, extending across the front of the throat, and ending at the
angle of right jaw, severing the skin, muscles and jugular vein and carotid artery. Either
wound would have caused death. From the position and nature of the wound. l am of opinion
they were self inflicted. Have seen deceased lately. About six weeks ago, while attending
his father, my attention was called to deceased's mental state by one of the family, a Mrs.
Brearton. She said she thought he was going out of his mind. Mrs. Brearton said whenever deceased
saw the doctor coming to the house, he used to run away and hide. When I met him afterwards
he seemed rather peculiar, and complained of the way his late father's age had been put in
the paper, younger than he really was. Deceased seemed very despondent, and greatly worried.</p>
<p>Thomas Nash Spong deposed: Deceased, whom I know, and his mother, Mary McCallum Wilson, called
upon me on Monday afternoon last. For the space of one hour they made enquiries of me concerning
Mrs. Wilson's freehold property and her mortgage interests. I produced to them mortgage documents.
During the whole hour deceased was with me he was perfectly competent to do all business.
With his own hand he made notes of mortgage properties and interest, and took memos away with
him. By her will she partly had given Robert her property. After the hour he showed considerable
tension of nerve and thought. He didn't speak until his mother left. Then he referred to his
father's will, and said his father had done as he liked; he had nothing to say on that score.
Just before his mother left he showed great vacancy of mind, and afterwards he rallied again.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict that deceased committed suicide by cutting his throat with a knife.</p>

<p>INCENDIARISM IN SALE.</p>
<p>An act of incendiarism appears to have been perpetrated on Tuesday evening,
by which a six roomed weatherboard cottage in Stawell Street was endangered. About a quarter
to 9 o'clock that evening, Mr. Checketts, of the engineering firm of Cherry and Checketts,
was proceeding along York street, when he noticed a glare of light across the vacant allotment
adjoining a cottage in Stawell street owned by Mrs. McCallum Wilson. He stood watching it
for a moment, and when flames burst out he ran up to the spot. He then saw that the fire proceeded
from the flooring of the verandah running along the side of the house, separated from the
vacant ground by a low picket fence. The flames had not got a strong hold, and a young man
named Davidson coming up they quickly stamped them out. They then saw the fire had been caused
by some pieces of hessian torn off the verandah and stuffed beneath the flooring. It was also
evident that kerosene had been plentifully sprinkled on the place. Constable Nupthine, being
on his beat in the neighbourhood, was met by Mr. Davison, and on searching around near the
verandah he discovered a copy of the &quot;Age&quot; newspaper saturated with kerosene. The
house is unoccupied, but adjoins a cottage which is tenanted. The owner, Mrs. McCallum Wilson,
has another cottage a little higher up the street also unoccupied, and neither buildings are
insured.</p>

<p>THE SALE WILL CASE.</p>
<p>RE MARY McCALLUM WILSON</p>
<p>ALLEGED UNDUE INFLUENCE AND INCAPACITY.</p>
<p>Proceedings were commenced in the Second Civil Court, on Monday, before Mr. Justice Hood,
in which it is sought to set aside the will of Mary McCallum Wilson, deceased, on the ground
of undue influence and testamentary incapacity, the caveator being her son, Frederick Wilson.
The deceased left Ireland many years ago, and arriving in Gippsland in 1843, married John
McCallum Wilson. There was four sons and four daughters born of the marriage. Wilson died,
leaving properly worth about £16,000. His daughters were excluded from the will. He bequeathed
his furniture to his widow, and also the right to live in the homestead as long as she remained
unmarried, and he gave her an annuity of £150, To his sons John and Alexander he devised land
at Sale in equal shires, and to his sons Robert and Frederick land at Maffra.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves, Q C., and Mr. W. H. Williams (instructed by Messrs Osborne and Osborne, for Messes
Patten and Staveley, of Sale) were for the executors; Mr. Duffy and Mr. Wasley (instructed
by Messrs Gillman, Pyfe and Shain) for the caveator.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves, in opening the case for the executors said that Mrs. Wilson, the testatrix, was
one of the pioneers of Gippsland, she having arrived there in 1843. Her husband was John McCallum
Wilson. During their married life they had eight children, four sons and four daughters. Mr.
Wilson was worth about £16,000 at the time of his death. He left his widow a life interest
in a portion of his property, together with an annuity of £150. He left land at Sale to his
sons John and Alexander in equal shares, and land at Maffra to his sons Robert and Frederick.
The sum of £100 was left to a granddaughter, Emily Breardon, but nothing was left to the daughters.
One of the sons, Robert, died intestate, and his share became devisable amongst his brothers
and sisters. The widow continued to live on at the homestead, and afterwards at Sale. From
time to time she had certain of her relatives with her. She made several wills. In October,
1895, a man named John Keogh Smith, a drover, went into her employ. It was his duty to light
the fire, sweep the house, look after the cattle, do general work about the house, and, amongst
other things, maintain the temperature of the bedroom at night. In May, 1896, she determined
to take some steps to secure Smith the benefits she intended to give him. In that year she
went to Messrs Patten and Staveley and instructed them to prepare an agreement, for the transfer
of certain property to Smith, The consideration expressed was that he would faithfully and
honestly serve her during her lifetime. From that time forward the relation of mother and
son practically existed between Mrs. Wilson and Mr. Smith. A deed to carry out Mrs. Wilson's
views was prepared, and subsequently she gave instruction for a similar agreement in favour
of her granddaughter, Emily Breardon. On 3rd February, 1897, she made her last will, by which
she bequeathed all her property to John Keogh Smith. She explained in her will that she had
not left anything to her sons, as they had already been provided for, neither did she leave
anything to her daughters for a similar reason, and also because they had not been a comfort
to her. Compared with the property possessed by her husband, the value of Mrs. Wilson's estate
was insignificant, being only about £600. The testatrix, who died on 2nd June last, was a
keen, shrewd old woman, who was perfectly competent to look after her affairs.</p>
<p>William Patten, solicitor, gave evidence in respect to the preparation of various wills executed
by the deceased. He described her as a very keen, sharp woman. Site told him that she came
from Ireland to Sydney in 1837 as a free emigrant. She said that, after being in service
there, she heard that a squatter in Gippsland required a servant, and she volunteered to come
to Victoria. She met her husband in Gippsland. He was a very rough man. She had a good memory
for the events of the early days of the colony.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: She was an eccentric woman?</p>
<p>Witness: Sometimes.</p>
<p>And dressed in an extraordinary fashion? —-Yes.</p>
<p>After her husband's death she cut short his moleskin trousers, and used them herself for the
rest of her life? —I am not aware of the fact.</p>
<p>Did you see her wearing her husband's leggings and boots?—I think not.</p>
<p>She had an accident to her head?—I have heard so.</p>
<p>She left your firm?—Yes.</p>
<p>If she says that Messrs Patten and Staveley threw her out of the office, and called her cranky,
what would you say?—It certainly was not true.</p>
<p>Did you know that she had made a transfer of her property to Smith?—Yes.</p>
<p>And the value of that property was £1820?—-Yes.</p>
<p>Did that cover all her property?—All hut something which she transferred to Mrs. Breardon.</p>
<p>Langton F. Staveley, solicitor, gave evidence in detail in reference to the preparation of
the will and other documents. He said that Mrs. Wilson particularly told him to put in the
agreement transferring her property to Smith, that he (Smith) had been kind to her, that he
had been observant of her wishes, had performed many acts of kindness to her, and had behaved
like a son. When the draft agreement was read over to her she approved of it, and said It
was exactly what she wanted. Smith subsequently called on witness, and owing to his calling
witness drafted an additional clause in the agreement, providing for thirty.one days holiday
per annum for Smith. When this was shown to Mrs. Wilson she said that it would not do, that
she would not he left alone, and if he took a holiday he must find a substitute to look after
her. She also said that the substitute must be to her liking, and the provision was modified
accordingly. He came to the conclusion that Mrs. Wilson was thoroughly competent to carry
out the various documents, and knew perfectly well what she wans doing. He was struck by her
shrewdness. He subsequently saw Mrs. Wilson in reference to the transfer to Mrs. Breardon
of property at Surrey Hills. The testatrix, who was ill at the time, agreed to the transfer,
which she had previously instructed her solicitor should be carried out. Mrs. Wilson said
she thought she had something to come out of her son Robert's estate, and she would like it
to be left to Mrs. Breardon. Witness said that he did not think that she had anything coming
to her, out of her son’s estate, but at her wish he made a codicil to carry out her wishes.
Mrs. Wilson attached her mark, with assistance, to this and the other documents. She was clear
and intelligent, although only a markswoman.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Duffy—Deceased has been called &quot;Old Mrs. Scotch Jock&quot; and
&quot;Cranky Mrs. lock.&quot; She had quarrelled with her daughters, and for that reason left
them out of her will.</p>
<p>To Mr. Purves.—The deceased's husband had been known as &quot;Scotch Jock.” Witness would
not like to say that anyone was cranky merely because some person said so.</p>
<p>Ernest D. Moors clerk of Courts at Sale, said he had frequently witnessed the signature of
the deceased. She was as clear headed and alert as any person he had ever come across.</p>
<p>Further evidence was given, and the hearing was adjourned till next day.</p>
<p>TUESDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<p>Daniel Sayer, saddler, knew the late Mrs. Wilson, and he had frequent opportunities of judging
her mental capacity. She appeared to him to he thoroughly sound, and he saw nothing which
would have suggested the opposite.</p>
<p>Henry Forde Scott, clergyman of the Church of England, had known her since March. When
he went there the old lady hobbled out on two sticks. He told her who he was, and that he
was the new Church of England minister. She said she did not care about seeing clergymen.
He told her that he thought she was a country-woman of his, and on comparing notes he found
that they came from adjoining counties in Ireland—Cork and Limerick. Mrs. Wilson said she
was nearly blind. As she did not ask him in, he asked her if she lived on the verandah altogether.
She smiled, and then asked him in. He talked to her about early days and general matters.
She said that her husband had died some years ago, and left his property divided among the
sons. Witness asked if he had given anything to the daughters, and she said no, as they did
not get on well together. She referred with considerable feeling to one of her sons, witness
though the eldest. She seemed to have a good deal of affection for him. She said that he committed
suicide, owing to his thinking he had not been fairly dealt with, under the will of his father.
She said that after tea he lit his pipe, and went for a walk. The next she heard was that
he was found on The Heart road, dead. He asked her if she was not friendly with her daughters,
and she said she was not; she could not get on with them, as they were not kind to her.
Smith came in, and as he left the room Mrs. Wilson said, &quot;That's my man, Smith; he's
the only one that has stuck to me; he manages my affairs, so I mean to stick to him.&quot;
Witness then spoke to her about religious matters. He asked her if she would like him to read
to her. She said she would, and he repeated some Scripture from memory. She asked him to
call again, and he did so about three weeks afterwards. At this interview she referred more
in detail to family matters. She repeated that her daughters had not been kind to her, and
that she could not live with them, though she had tried, and that she did not Intend to leave
them anything. He pointed out to her that she ought not to neglect her family. She spoke,
he thought, with a feeling more of pain than anger. He thought her character was inquisitive
and superstitious, but that her intellect was clear. She spoke about her mortgages, and her
trouble with lawyers. She said something about remembering him, but he told her not to trouble
about that.</p>
<p>To Mr. Duffy: She said she had had trouble with Mr. Spang, and took her business away from
him. He claimed to he better qualified to form an opinion of a person's sanity than anyone
in Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: Would you not make one exception?</p>
<p>Witness: No. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>George Geddes said that he did some repairing work for Mrs. Wilson in November, and got instructions
from her. She was shrewd, sharp, and clear headed in all her dealings with him. She said her
family had treated her badly. He saw nothing to suggest to him that she was otherwise than
sane.</p>
<p>To Mr. Duffy: He had heard Mrs. Wilson spoken of as &quot;Mrs. Scotch Jock&quot; but not as
&quot;cranky Mrs. Scotch Jock.&quot; He saw nothing eccentric about her.</p>
<p>Annie De Tong, wife of George De Tong, was in the service of Mrs. Wilson about ten years ago,
as general servant. Mrs. Wilson was sane, and a good business woman. One son lived with her—John,
Alick and Frederick used to come there. If deceased asked her sons to nail a paling on they
would not do it. They asked her why she could not get a man and pay him. When Mrs. Wilson
met her sons in the street they would not speak to her. Mrs. Wilson told her that her family
would not get a penny belonging to her, the reason being that they did not treat her as sons
and daughters ought to do.</p>
<p>To Mr. Duffy: Was at the house when Mr. Wilson gave his wife the blow which caused an injury
to her head. Mrs. Wilson was a bit curious the way she dressed, and in her manners. She never
heard of her being called cranky.</p>
<p>To Mr. Purves: Mrs. Wilson did not dress as other ladies dressed, she dressed old fashioned.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: Did you ever see her walk about in moleskin trousers and top boots?</p>
<p>Witness: No.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: She did not get the reversion of them till her husband died.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: How was she curious? Did she stand on her head to eat her dinner— No.</p>
<p>Did she smoke a short pipe?—No.</p>
<p>Did she turn Catherine Wheel?—No, She was rough.</p>
<p>Mary Sawl, who had known the deceased, described her as a shrewd, cute business woman. Deceased
told her she was very well pleased with Mr. Smith in looking after her affairs. The house
was kept clean, and Mrs. Wilson seemed to me to be well looked after. She fretted about her
eldest son. She thought the others would squander money, and that they should have visited
her more. Witness saw her on the day of her death, and she seemed as sensible as ever she
was in her life. Witness asked her if she should send for her family, and she said she did
not want them. Witness regarded her as perfectly sane, and never saw anything to make her
think otherwise.</p>
<p>Thomas Edward Tanges had worked at the Wilson's off and on some years ago. He looked on Mrs.
Wilson as sane &quot;right enough,&quot; and a shrewd business woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: Did you notice anything strange about her dress?—She used to cut the tops off
her husband's Wellington boots and pull them over hers.</p>
<p>Do you think that was sane or insane? I don't know what you call that. I suppose it was sane.
I reckon she did it to keep her legs warm! (Laughter.)—Yes.</p>
<p>Were there disagreements between the family?—When Mrs. Wilson spoke at the breakfast table,
John would say, &quot;Shut up, you dirty Irish.&quot; Then she would make a welt at him over
the table. (Laughter)</p>
<p>And what would she say?—&quot;The dirty, Irish are better than the dirty scotch.” (Laughter.)</p>
<p>To Mr. Duffy: He told a clerk to the solicitor on the other side that Mrs. Wilson was a little
bit off. She used to dress in funny clothes, with a big hat.</p>
<p>Maria Greenwood, who had mortgaged land to the deceased, said that the latter complained to
her of her children not being kind to her. Witness considered that Mrs. Wilson was perfectly
sane, and a thorough business woman.</p>
<p>John Keogh Smith, dealer, said that he had known the testatrix for about twelve years. The
first time he had business reIations with her was six or seven years ago. He had borrowed
£100 from her, through her solicitor, at 10 per cent. In August, 1895, he had a conversation
with her in reference to getting a man to look after her place. He made inquiries about a
man, and told her he could not get one. She asked him if he would come himself, and he said
that he did not think he could. Afterwards he consented to come. She instructed him as to
his duties, and told him he could look after his own business.</p>
<p>YESTERDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves had his fund of patience pretty well exhausted to-day, by the witness, John Keogh
Smith, who is the chief beneficiary under the will of Mary McCallum Wilson. The witness gave
his evidence in a slow, solid style, which highly exasperated the Q C., who occasionally opened
out warmly on Smith. These occasional outbursts were interspersed with cutting observations
at the expense of the witness, but he went on at the same steady pace, without allowing his
equanimity to be ruffled by counsel.</p>
<p>Mr Purves: &quot;It is suggested you are a married man.&quot; Witness: &quot;It Is false.&quot;
Mr. Purves: &quot;That is slander.&quot; Mr Justice Hood: &quot;Is it a slander to say that
a man is a married man.&quot; Mr Purves: &quot;It is a gross reflection on a man who is Iiving
as a bachelor.&quot; Mr. Duffy: It destroys his reputation, with a certain class of people.</p>
<p>J. K. Smith (continuing) said that one of his duties was to keep up the temperature of Mrs.
Wilson's sleeping room. He was to read and write for her. He went to Mr. Bushell's with her
and when she left she said she had instructed him to make out a will. She said she expected
her children would dispute her will. She told him that if he stuck to her during life she
would transfer her property to him. On the day the will was executed Mrs. Wilson drew out
£276 from the Post-Office Savings Bank and instructed him to lodge £160 in his own name to
pay off the mortgage due to Mallett. He was to retain the remainder to pay expenses connected
with the household. In August she made the will leaving her property to him for life, and
afterwards to the Police superannuation fund. She told him he had been a good son to her and
that she would be a good mother to him.</p>

<p>THE SALE WILL CASE.</p>
<p>RE MARY McALLUM WILSON</p>
<p>ALLEGED UNDUE INFLUENCE AND INCAPACITY.</p>
<p>JUDGMENT RESERVED.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy in opening the case for the caveator said it seemed absurd that Smith was willing
to serve Mrs. Wilson for a year for nothing, and then that he should get £1823 for serving
her for the remainder of her life.
</p>
<p>His Honor: On the other hand, it was not a bad bargain for her.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: Yes. It was an exceedingly bad one, if she wanted to keep her money.</p>
<p>His Honor: But she had a life interest in the property.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy said it would he shown that Smith kept dinning into Mrs. Wilson's ears that she
should make a deed of gift, as a will might he upset. He thought that the evidence would shown
that the will was one which should be upset.</p>
<p>Elijah Napthine, constable of police, examined by Mr. Wasley, said that he was stationed at
Sale. He first became acquainted with Mrs. Wilson at the beginning of 1895. She was then living
at &quot;The Violets,&quot; Sale. He called on her on one occasion. As soon as she saw him
she said, &quot;Oh, it's one of you good policemen.&quot; He told her what he came for, and
was going to leave, when she said, &quot;I could not live without you policemen; my property
is not safe or my life.&quot; She said she was frightened of those &quot;curse of God&quot;
children of hers, she was frightened to drink anything about the place for fear it was poisoned.
She also said that they might come at night and kill her. When he left she asked him to promise
to come back, as he was the only protection she had. He saw her again a few months afterwards.
She complained of her children, and was afraid they would poison her. He saw her a third time
in July, 1895. He informed her that one of her places had caught fire. She said they were
all trying to injure her, and she could not go to her bed at night for fear of them. She
then dropped on her knees and said, &quot;May God curse these wretches.&quot;</p>
<p>To Mr. Purves: He could not say what duty it was he went on to Mrs. Wilson.</p>
<p>His Honor: Was she a sober woman?</p>
<p>Witness: As far as I could see.</p>
<p>Jane Andersnn, boardinghouse keeper, Sale, said that Mrs Wilson received an injury to her
head thirteen years ago. She complained bitterly of her head not being closed and of her sight
being bad. There was a hollow or opening in the head, into which witness had put her finger.
She wore a bandage on her head, which she put on before she spoke of business. She said that
this was to keep her brains together. Her head became worse of late years. She had many peculiarities
of manner. She complained that her relatives were robbing her, and she was in dread of them
poisoning her. On the 3rd July, 1895, Mrs. Wilson came crying and complaining, and she had
got someone to bring her to witness to save her life. She said she could not go back to her
relatives, as they would poison her. Mrs. Wilson stayed with her that night. She cried and
paced the room all night, complaining that they wanted to take her life. She always wanted
tea to be tasted before it was given to her by her grandchild. She asked one of her boarders,
a young man named William Ray, to marry her.</p>
<p>His Honor: And what did Mr. Ray say to that?</p>
<p>Witness: He said, &quot;If that is what you want, I don't wish to remain in your service any
longer.&quot; Mrs. Wilson went down on her knees, and witness lifted her up. She used to wear
her husband's old boots and leggings. She wore a leather belt round her waist, with a number
of loops of tape, to which were attached bits of linen or white cloth. These eccentricities
were not the result of drink, as Mrs. Wilson was a sober woman. If she went from one room
to another at night she would ask witness to go before her, and see if the way was clear,
and if anyone was waiting on her. She desired the door of her room to be locked, and something
put at the bottom for fear she might be chloroformed. She asked that cakes made by her grand-daughter
might be thrown out, as there might be a dose of poison in them. She cautioned witness not
to have any dealings with Messrs Patten and Staveley, as they robbed and threw her into the
street with her paper. She said they called her a cranky old something.</p>
<p>THURSDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.</p>
<p>William Alfred Ray, had known Mrs. Wilson for some years. He did some work for her at her
house in 1894. When he had been there a fortnight Mrs. Wilson said she would give him 10s
a week to look after the place. He accepted the offer after consideration. The first day he
was there Mrs. Wilson spoke of her family, alluding to them as an ungrateful lot. She said
they did not make enough of her, and should adore her as an angel mother. This occurred very
often on and off. She often said she was afraid of her life, and that some of her family would
do her an injury for the sake of what she had. She said that her son-in-law (McGuigan) had
bought a gallon of whisky. She reckoned there was poison in it, and wanted him to take it
to the police for analysis. To satisfy her he did so. He told her analysis would cost money,
and the best thing she could do was to empty it into gutter. This was the advice of the constable,
and it was followed. He emptied the demijohn into tlhe gutter. She said, &quot;God bless us,
there goes my twenty-four shillings into the gutter.&quot; (Laughter). She said that whoever
she left her property to, she never intended to leave it to her relatives and they would only
get the interest. She often said she would leave her property to the unborn. When he asked
what she meant, she said they were people who had never lived, and who had done her no harm.
Witness had seen her stripped almost to the waist in the day time. He had also seen her on
the verandah with one garment on only. She wore a bandage on her head; it was rolled round
the head. She said that she must have a bandage on her head, because her brains were lying
open like those of a new born babe. There was an opening in the head as if the bones were
apart. She often complained about her head. Once at Mr. Sincock's office, she told him she
wanted to make a will in his favor, on condition that he would remain with her as her intended
husband. He turned round and looked at her, saying, &quot;Is that all you want?&quot; and
walked out of the office. On the way home she said, &quot;See what I have done for you; I
have willed you the whole of my property.&quot; He said he did not want anything to do with
it. He said she could leave it to those who were most entitled to it. He advised her on another
occasion to get someone to look after her, as she was not capable of looking after herself.
He told her he did not intend to remain. She asked him not to leave her, and he would not
regret it. He left, but returned that day, and when he returned Mrs. Wilson asked his advise
as to whether she should stay with Mrs. Anderson and he advised her to do so, if she would
not stay with her own relatives. At the table at Mrs. Anderson's, Mrs. Wilson said that if
he (witness) had any sense he would marry her and get a younger one afterwards. (Laughter.)
Once Mrs. Anderson sued her for board and lodging at the Police Court. Mr. Wise, the solicitor,
spoke of her being eccentric. She said, &quot;It's a lie,&quot; and pulling off her hat, said,
&quot;Look, I am as pure and as fresh as a thirty-year old.&quot; (Laughter.) At the end of
last year or beginning of this, witness had a conversation with Smith, and asked him how he
was getting on with the old woman. Smith said, &quot;She's a rum old stick.&quot; He also
said, &quot;Of course, you know as well as I do that a will of hers would be little or no
good; the only thing I can see would be a deed of gift. He remarked that she was so changeable
in her mind; one day she would say one thing, and another, another. On another occasion, witness
asked him what they were going to do. Smith said, &quot;I don't care what they do; the only
thing they can upset is the bit of a will of Mrs. Breardon's, and if they do that, the law
will swallow it up in expenses&quot; After a dog was killed and buried in the yard, Mrs. Wilson
used to pour water on it. She said that the reason was to make the curse of God rest on it.</p>
<p>To Mr. Purves: The dog was one which he gave her.</p>
<p>Mr. Purres: Do you say she was mad?</p>
<p>Witness: I don't say that she was mad exactly. I used to consider she had very curious ways.
She understood the contract I made with her. I did not take advantage of her and could not
have done so.</p>
<p>Do you say that you, a respectable man, watched at old woman washing herself on the verandah
at night?—It was In the middle of the day. The house is about a hundred yards from, and in
view of the street.</p>
<p>When she was washing she would not suppose that you were working would she? She was not so
mad as that. Why did she do it?—Perhaps to dare her granddaughter. She was a woman of strong
passions and of stubborn character.</p>
<p>Don't you think it was natural that Mrs. Wilson should be annoyed that she should have been
sued by Mrs. Anderson for £7 for board and lodging when she had had £33 worth of additions
made to Mrs. Anderson's house?— Mrs. Wilson wished to do it.</p>
<p>Suppose Mrs. Wilson had died after making a will in your favor would you have taken the property?
— I believe I would not take it.</p>
<p>His Honor: Why?</p>
<p>Witness: I don't think that I would he justified in taking it from her own family.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: Is it your view that a father or mother cannot, under any circumstances leave
their property away from their family?—They could if they had a reason, but I did not see
any reason here.</p>
<p>His Honor: Are you serious when you say that you would not take it if the family were left
out.</p>
<p>Witness: I would not be justified.</p>
<p>But would you? —No; I would not.</p>
<p>When she wanted to marry you did you think she was in earnest? — I believe that she was in
earnest, but I would not take much notice of it.</p>
<p>Richard Ray deposed to eccentricities on the part of deceased. He had seen Mrs. Wilson in
the yard, attired only in her chemise and a pair of leather leggings. She was visible from
the street.</p>
<p>To Mr. Purves: Mrs. Wilson was sensible in money matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: I want you to state on what point you think she was mad.</p>
<p>Witness: On a great many points.</p>
<p>When an old woman comes out of the shed, where she has been washing, in a chemise and leather
legging, is that a sign of insanity?—Not far from it.</p>
<p>What about your maternal ancestress, If you had one. Was Eve mad when she walked about with
fig leaves on her? (Laughter.) If so, then every one in the South Sea Islands is stark staring
mad, come?—I don't think that a sane woman would do it.</p>
<p>Have you seen the unfortunate women in the Gippsland bush clad only in a bran bag with a couple
of holes in it!—I have not see them.</p>
<p>Have you been to the theatre since you have been down? —Yes.</p>
<p>I should think so. Did you see the women on the stage? —Yes.</p>
<p>Well, they showed a great deal more than Mrs. Wilson?—They are well covered up. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>His Honor: What would you call not being well covered up?</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: Did you make a will for Mrs. Wilson?</p>
<p>Witness: Yes.</p>
<p>Did you think it a proper thing?—I wanted to please her. I did not see much in it. I took
no notice of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves read the will, which filled both sides of a sheet of notepaper.</p>
<p>Witness said that he got the instructions from Mrs. Wilson.</p>
<p>Mr Purees: Do you know that her son, Fred Wilson, is a drunkard?—He takes a drop sometimes.</p>
<p>Who is paying you?—I don't know.</p>
<p>The caveator has not a halfpenny. I only want to make you feel comfortable. (Laughter). Would
you have come at your own expense if he had asked you?—I did not come at my own expense. I
got money from Mr. Nicholson.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen Fred, drunk, or rather, have you ever seen him sober?—He may have had a
glass or two.</p>
<p>Was he sober yesterday?—Yes.</p>
<p>Was he drunk the day before?—He may have had a glass.</p>
<p>Don't you know that he had to be carted away?</p>
<p>Emily Brearton, a widow, grand-daughter of the accused, deposed to eccentricities on the part
of Mrs. Wilson. Referring to the dog-killing incident, she add that the dog was cut open,
and kerosene having been poured into the animal, it was placed on the kitchen fire. The testatrix
said there was then a good fire to cook scones with. (Laughter). Once Mrs. Wilson had deeds
on the table. Mrs. Wilson said, &quot;The good dear man (Smith) wishes me to give you the
Surrey Hills property.&quot; Witness replied, &quot;Mother, don't bother: I will live with
you: your time is short.&quot; Mrs. Wilson afterwards told her she must go, as Smith was not
friendly with her. She did not leave because of a quarrel with Talbot. Witness had heard Smith
tell Mrs. Wilson that her children were not worthy of being called children, and he told her
not to waste her love on them.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: When did you first make up your mind that Smith was a dishonest intriguer? — When
I went I saw that things were not as they ought to be.</p>
<p>You would not go back if he was there?—I would have lived there, if I had not been told that
I would be thrown out.</p>
<p>You write: &quot;Mr. Smith — Dear Sir, I am very sorry to hear that grandmother has been so
bad. I hope you will persuade her to have Dr. Browne, as I hear he is a good man.&quot; If
he had such power over her why did you write in that vein? — I knew he could persuade her.
He knew her soft points.</p>
<p>What were they?—That is for you to say.</p>
<p>Is that a feminine slander?—He knew her weak points.</p>
<p>What were they? I have heard of none yet. This Dr. Browne does not happen to be Dr. Valentine
Browne? — I believe he is. He attended my late grandfather.</p>
<p>Are you aware that he is a witness? — I believe he is.</p>
<p>Is he here? — I don't see him.</p>
<p>You are like Sam Weller. You look up and say you don't see him up there. (Laughter). Are you
always as mild as now? — No.</p>
<p>Do you remember a little incident about the washing, when you told her she was an old swine!—
Yes; she wanted to boil bags with white linen.</p>
<p>I ask you, as an expert, did you never see bags boiled with white linen. By bags I don't mean
trousers?— I know the difference.</p>
<p>I don't know the difference. My trousers are very like bags. (Laughter).</p>
<p>You thought you were justified in calling her an old swine!— I had provocation.</p>
<p>Are you going to give the property at Surrey Hill to the relatives? —Certainly not (very
decisevely).</p>
<p>Oh! You are worse than a Supreme Court Judge. (Laughter.) — If the law gives it to me I will
take it. I consider I have as much right to it as Smith.</p>
<p>Emily Brearton was asked by Mr. Justice Hood what she said to Mrs. Wilson when the latter
spoke of her relatives' designs against her.</p>
<p>Witness: I said it was nonsense.</p>
<p>What did she say? — She said, Yes they would.</p>
<p>What did you say about the whisky poisoning incident? — I said it was nonsense. I was not
afraid to drink it.</p>
<p>Did you drink it? — I tasted it.</p>
<p>Why did you stay on with this mad woman— I did so at the request of my grandfather, who asked
me to do so if I could possibly put up with her.</p>
<p>Were you employed at wages? —Yes; at 10s per week.</p>
<p>Did she pay it regularly? — No; I had to summons her.</p>
<p>Jane Talbot, who had been with Mrs. Wilson said she feared her family would poison her. She
complained that Mr. McGuigan, her son-in law, had put poison in a gallon of whiskey which
he had given her. She stated that she had made a will in favor of her daughter, Mrs. Dowling
and that she then found that Mrs. Dowling was robbing her. She seemed to be very fond of Mrs.
Brearton at times. Mrs. McInnes brought her a little basket of apples. After Mrs. McInnes
had gone, Mrs. Wilson gave the apples to Smith, but told him that he was running a great risk.
Mr. Smith used to keep the spirits locked up, and he would give her some now and then.</p>
<p>Archibald MacDonald had known deceased for 30 years. Some years ago he attended her late husband.
The old lady would not allow her son Frederick to go for the medicine because she said he
had arranged with witness to poison her husband. Next morning he asked the deceased why he
had not had his medicine. She answered, &quot;I would not give it to him. You and Fred have
made up your minds to poison him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Purves: Do you consider eccentricity a sign of madness? —No.</p>
<p>You are eccentric?—Yes.</p>
<p>William De Tracey Tracey, actuary of Savings Banks, said he knew the deceased for 40 years.
She always carried her pass book under her garments, fastened to a leather belt by tapes.
When she came into the bank she would lift up her dress some distance to get at the book.
In latter years she was a woman, in his opinion, who could be easily influenced. For instance,
he believed he could have induced her to make a will in his favor had he tried. She often
said her own flesh and blood were cruel and undutiful, and that she lived in dread of her
life because of them.</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: She used to pull up her skirt to get at the book?—Yes.</p>
<p>But there was a petticoat underneath? Not always. Sometimes she had only a pair of moleskin
trousers under her dress.</p>
<p>Charles Carter and James Smith, carpenters, residing at Sale, also gave evidence relative
to conversations with Smith.</p>
<p>ON FRIDAY.</p>
<p>Donald Nicolson, managing law clerk to Messrs Gillman, Fyfe, and Shair, Sale, said he had
known the old lady as long as he could remember, and intimately for about twenty years. She
was in the habit of complaining bitterly of her head, and of saying they had smashed her brain.
She spoke generally of her children trying to rob and poison her, and her fear seemed genuine.
</p>
<p>To Mr. Williams: She came to the office of Mr. Bushe, solicitor, where witness was employed,
apparently on business. 0n one occasion she said she was going to get Mr. Bushe to make a
will for her, but he did not make any wills for her whilst witness was in his employ.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams: Do you think she was insane?</p>
<p>I think she was peculiar, eccentric, but not insane enough to put in an asylum.</p>
<p>Do you think she could conduct her business with Mr. Bushe?—Fairly well.</p>
<p>Would he be justified in charging her?—I don't know whether he charged her.</p>
<p>Can you remember any business that you did for Mrs. Wilson?—Not personally.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: Was there any ground for Mrs. Wilson's delusions as to her children?</p>
<p>Witness: Not the slightest.</p>
<p>Janet Hargreave, daughter of deceased, said that she lived with her mother until she was married.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: When was that?</p>
<p>Witness: I don't remember.</p>
<p>I thought all ladies remembered that?—It is so long ago—about 33 years. Witness went on to
say that she had twice lived with her mother since her marriage. When she went to live with
her mother in 1894 she thought her very eccentric. She was always railing against her family,
and saying they wanted to poison her. Witness got on very well for the first week or two,
and then she could not put up with it. Mrs. Wilson wanted her to get up at four in the morning
and milk the cows. Witness would not do so, and cleared out. Her mother wanted her to dig
in the garden, and she would not. Mrs. Wilson went away and locked the rooms up, leaving witness
nothing to eat.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy: What did you do for forage?</p>
<p>Witness: Sent to Sale for bread.</p>
<p>And how long did she stay away?—Three days.</p>
<p>And what did she say when she came back?—She said, &quot;Are you here yet?&quot; (Laughter).
I stopped that day, and got my brother to take me away in a dray. There was a reconciliation,
and I came back. Mrs. Wilson spoke of her daughters trying to poison her. Witness stayed from
May until September, 1894. Mrs. Wilson wanted her to go to the paddock for a horse. Witness
objected, and quarrels arose. In September Mrs. Wilson got a lot of bags, and said, &quot;Oh,
God, must I leave this house; my wicked children are trying to kill me,&quot; She then went
on the verandah and called out &quot;Murder,&quot; &quot;Police.&quot; Witness was frightened,
and got her clothes and left. Witness saw her mother when she was very ill, but she did not
know one daughter from another. After the death of Mrs. Wilson, witness saw Smith, who spoke
of compromising with the girls. She saw him afterwards in Mrs. Dowling's bar. He was a little
the worse for drink. John Wilson was there. They had a quarrel, and Wilson hit Smith across
the counter. Smith said, &quot;John, you need not think you are going to get anything; whatever
I am going to do, I am going to do for the women.&quot; Witness and her sisters subsequently
attended at Mesrs Patten anti Staveley's and saw him about the matter concerning which she
had spoken to Smith. Mr. Patten said, &quot; I am not going to have it said that I made a
will for a mad woman.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Purves: Do you think that is a sign of madness to wear a man's felt had with a cocks feather
in it.</p>
<p>Witness: She wore more than that. She wore trousers.</p>
<p>Now you are a decent, honest hard-working woman?—What!</p>
<p>Did you ever wear men's boots?—Never.</p>
<p>Why?—Because I have boots of my own.</p>
<p>I presume you were very industrious?—Why so.</p>
<p>When you went to your mother's, you objected to get up early?—What do you call early? (Laughter).</p>
<p>Going home with the milk; what do you call it?—Do you consider four in the morning a fit time
for an old woman of fifty to get up?</p>
<p>Was it four in the morning?—Yes.</p>
<p>Was it light?—No, quite dark. You could not see your hand. I used to open the window to see
what time it was.</p>
<p>What month was this?—January.</p>
<p>Quite sure?—Yes, it would be three o'clock.</p>
<p>I have my suspicions about your eyesight. —My eyesight is not so bad.</p>
<p>Did she complain of your lying in bed until nine in the morning?—It is false.</p>
<p>Did she do so?—No.</p>
<p>Did you talk to her as you do to me?—No.</p>
<p>Why do you adopt that tone to me? What have I done?—You are trying to puzzle me.</p>
<p>You began by trying to jump down my throat. Why did you adopt that tone to me?—You are trying
to baffle me.</p>
<p>But you adopted that tone to Mr. Duffy and he was trying to lead you?—I can't help it; it
is my manner.</p>
<p>You were frightened of your mother?—Yes, I was frightened that she would kill me, because
she said she would leave my blood on her.</p>
<p>Do you mean to say that a poor old woman like her would be a match for you?—My mother could
give me a welt that I could never get the better of. She has done it. She could have thrown
away her sticks, and could walk as well as you could.</p>
<p>Could she talk as well as you?—Sometimes.</p>
<p>Are you sane?—Do you think I am insane. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>I think you and you mother were both sane?—I don't think she was sane in some things.</p>
<p>There is nothing you are cracked about?—What do you say? (Laughter.) I don't know the meaning
of cracked.</p>
<p>Well, cranky?—Do you thing I am cranky? (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Don't ask me, because I might say yes, though I would not like to. Why would you not dig in
the garden?—I was not going to dig in the garden. It was not female's work.</p>
<p>I beg to differ with you.—If you were a married man, you like your wife to dig in the garden?
(Laughter.)
</p>
<p>Certainly. (Laughter.)</p>
<p>Isabella McInnes, another daughter of the deceased, said that she considered her mother not
very right in her head.</p>
<p>James Henry McGuigan, mariner, a son-in-law of the testatrix, deposed to supporting testatrix
will a demijohn of whisky. She said that poison had been put into it to kill her. She said,
&quot;You —— wretch, you have tried to poison me with that whisky.&quot; Witness said that
if she covered the three acre paddock with sovereigns he would not poison her.</p>
<p>So Mr. Purves: He had not been making up the poison with the family.</p>
<p>This closed the case for the caveator.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy submitted that the testatrix was subject to delusions which acted on her mind when
making a will. His Honor reserved his decision.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 13 September 1897 p 2 Article</h3>
<p>Mr. Justice Hood gave judgment on Thursday in the McCallum Wilson will case. The will was
upheld with costs against the caveator, Frederick Wilson. Mr. Purves and Mr. Williams, instructed
by Messrs Patten and Staveley, appeared for the executors, and Mr. Duffy and Mr. Wasley, instructed
by Messrs Gillman, Fyffe and Shain for the caveator.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 20 September 1897 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AT SALE. Some excitement prevailed in the town yesterday afternoon and evening
when the news became circulated that Mr. Fred Wilson, caveator in the recent McCallum Wilson
will case, had attempted to commit suicide by taking a dose of strychnine. As usual in such
cases rumors were freely circulated contradictory in facts but all to the effect that the
attempt had been made and that it was likely to be attended with fatal results. The real facts
as far as are obtainable are to the effect that Wilson remained in bed all Sunday morning
until about mid-day when he got up and deliberately poured a large quantity of strychnine
into his hand, swallowed it and then after taking a drink of water again retired to bed. Mr.
Robt. Manley, who resides close handy was called in and applied several mixtures to induce
vomiting pending the arrival of Dr. Gibbs, who had been communicated with. Upon Dr. Gibbs'
arrival the usual restoratives were applied after which Wilson was removed to the hospital.
Although the patient is showing signs of improvement Dr. Gibbs states he is by no means out
of danger. There is no authentic reason advanced so far as to the real cause of the attempt,
but it is believed that the adverse judgment in the will case, combined with heavy drinking
habits, led up to the action. Wilson is reported as having been under the influence of drink
on Saturday and he returned home late in the evening. The quantity of poison swallowed was
about six grains whilst from a quarter to half a grain is the recognised fatal dose. The rash
act was witnessed by Wilson's wife who, however, was powerless to interfere.

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Thursday 23 September 1897 p 2 Article</h3>
<p>MR. Fred Wilson has been improving wonderfully under the care of Dr. Gibbs at the hospital,
and in all probability will be well enough to leave the institution within a day or two.

<p>Frederick Wilson was proceeded against at the Sale police court on Friday on a charge of having
attempted to commit suicide. The circumstances have already been detailed in the Gippsland
Times. Mr. Cresswell, P.M., presided, and after administering good advice as to Wilson's actions
in the future discharged him.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 13 June 1898 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>SALE POLICE COURT'. (Before Messrs. Johnstone and Pettit, J.P.)</p>
<p>A MISERABLE HOME. A most pitiable
case was called on at the police court on Friday morning, when Mrs. Fred Wilson was charged,
as a matter of form, with &quot;vagrancy.&quot; According to the statement of Sergeant Davies
it appears that on Thursday last Mrs. Wilson, with a young child at her breast, presented
herself at the police station in a half clad condition, and asked that she it might be locked
up, stating that unless she was not put under restraint she would &quot;do away&quot; with
her children, as her husband had deserted his home and had left his family without protection
and in a state if abject poverty. It appears that Mrs. Wilson has incessantly of late meditated a
recurrence of the McCarthy tragedy which occurred a few weeks ago at Yarraville, and had gone
so far on one occasion as to induce her children to go into a room, where she asked them to
lay their heads on the floor while she decapitated them with an axe she carried in her hand.
On another occasion it is stated that Mrs. Wilson took her children to the Canal wharf and
but, for the interposition of a man standing by would have thrown them into the water with
the object of drowning them.</p>
<p>At the court on Friday Dr. Macdonald, gaol medical officer, deposed
that he had visited Mrs. Wilson in her cell and found her suffering from a severe attack of
measles, and consequently she was unable to appear before the court that morning. Witness
stated he had been intimately acquainted with the family for a number of years, and had, a
few weeks ago. visited her house on a medical summons, and found her considerably eccentric,
a fact not to be wondered at considering the discomforting position the unfortunate woman
was placed in, as the house was almost devoid of furniture, and presented a most miserable
spectacle.</p>
<p>On the application of Sergeant Davies a remand of a week was granted.</p>
<p>John, Thomas, Fred and Annie Wilson, the children of the unfortunate woman, the eldest of whom is probably
nine years of age, were then charged with being neglected children. The police found them
alone in the house after the mother had given herself up.</p>
<p>Mrs. McInnes attended the court to state she would take charge of the children until Mrs. Wilson's recovery or the return
of the husband. Mrs. McInnes also stated she had found £3 in the house.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances the bench decided to hear the cases in a week, when perhaps the mother will have recovered
sufficiently to appear. The bench instructed a warrant to be issued for the arrest of the
husband on a charge of wife desertion.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 20 June 1898 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>SALE POLICE COURT. FRIDAY JUNE 17TH. (Before Mr Cresswell, P.M.)</p>
<p>AN UNFORTUNATE CASE.</p>
<p>Annie Wilson was charged with having no lawful visible means of support.</p>
<p>Sergeant Davies repeated his statement of the previous Friday, which appeared in last Monday's
issue of the Times, adding that he believed Mrs. Wilson's mind to be unhinged.</p>
<p>Dr. Macdonald stated he understood, from a visit to Mrs. Wilson's house, that she had been left without
food and means; but that was only her own statement to him, not his own knowledge. He was
of opinion that it would be better to send her for medical treatment, and he thought she was
a fit subject for the Lunatic Asylum.</p>
<p>A female warder at the Sale gaol deposed that while
in gaol Mrs. Wilson appeared to be forgetful in her mind, as if from trouble. She had not
threatened to destroy the child that was with her in gaol, in her presence, but talked a great
deal to herself.</p>
<p>Mrs. McInnes, a relative, stated the woman had not looked after her children
of late, and was quite incompetent either to cook or wash for them. The eldest of Mrs. Wilson's
sons had told witness that his mother had threatened to kill them with an axe. The children
were starving but it was not that she hadn't money to purchase food, because one of the children
had found £3 tied in a handkerchief, which was placed in a hat box. Witness met the eldest
boy on one occasion, and asked him if he were hungry, and he replied, &quot;Yes, I am hungry,
but I have 2s 6d, and I am going to buy something to eat.&quot; The boy told witness he had
taken the money from his mother.</p>
<p>Mr. Cresswell decided to hear the following cases before
he gave a decision.</p>
<p>ALLEGED WIFE DESERTION.</p>
<p>Frederick Wilson was then charged with having left his wife and family
without means of support.</p>
<p>Mr. Shain appeared for the defendant.</p>
<p>Sergeant Davies stated that from what Mrs. Wilson had informed him on the day she gave herself up, he visited defendant's
house and found neither clothing nor food there. He took the children into custody, and issued
a warrant for the arrest of Wilson. On the Tuesday following Wilson came to the police station
and gave himself up.</p>
<p>To Mr. Shain: Mrs. Wilson did not make any statement that his client
had left her £8 when he left home. He did not see the children with any money.</p>
<p>The hearing of the case was then deferred until the following case was dealt with.</p>
<p>NEGLECTED CHILDREN.</p>
<p>John, Thomas, Frederick and Annie Wilson were then charged with being neglected
children.</p>
<p>Sergeant Davies repeated the evidence give in the previous case, adding that one
of the children had stated that they had had little or nothing to eat for a week. The boy
also stated that his mother had told him that the only money they had had from their father
for some considerable time previous was one shilling. The children when arrested were very
poorly clad and very dirty.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson, horse dealer, the father of the children, said he
was employed at Roseneath, and left Sale in April last. At that time he did not notice anything
wrong with his wife. He left a cheque for £8, drawn on his employer, Dawson, for the maintenance
of his wife when leaving for Roseneath, and left his address. Some time later he had occasion
to leave Roseneath, and went to Mallacoota. His wife knew he went there. He had sent her £2
just before he returned to Sale from Mallacoota, about a month ago. He did not know of his
wife's mental condition until last Monday, when he heard of the whole of the circumstances;
also that a warrant had been issued for his arrest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson: You did know, because I told you. How much did you give me?</p>
<p>Witness: I gave you £2. Mrs. Wilson: You only gave me a pound.</p>
<p>Witness (continuing) said that when he heard the news he came straight to Sale and gave himself
up to Sergeant Davies. He was in a position to support his children.</p>
<p>Mr. Creswell: If we allow them into your care what do you propose to do with them?</p>
<p>Witness: I will have to take them away with me and get a woman to look after them.</p>
<p>Sergeant Davies: Are you sure you gave your wife £2 since you went away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson: It was £1 unless it never came to me.</p>
<p>Witness: I sent £2.</p>
<p>Sergeant Davies: Were you drunk in Sale on Tuesday night and on two or three occasions
since you came back?</p>
<p>Mr. Shain objected to the question.</p>
<p>By Sergeant Davies: I have no property and am getting 30s per week and keep.</p>
<p>Fred Wilson, one of the children, also gave evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Creswell said it was contrary to the aims of justice to consign children to the care and
guidance of the Department for Neglected Children when they had a strong able bodied father
to depend upon, and they would be placed in his care. But the father would have to make some
substantial provision for them, because their mother was, apparently, too demented and incompetent
to care for them. With reference to the case against Mrs. Wilson, he would direct Sergeant
Davies to have her examined by two medical practitioners to ascertain definitely whether the
woman was a fit subject for a lunatic asylum. The case against Wilson would be dismissed.
The court then adjourned until 2 o'clock.</p>
<p>Drs. Macdonald and Gibbs examined Mrs. Wilson later on, and, upon the court resuming in the afternoon, 
certified that she was not fit to be at large.</p>
<p>Mr. Creswell therefore ordered her to the Kew Lunatic Asylum, to which place she was
taken by the afternoon train on Friday.</p>

<p>MAFFRA COURT OF PETTY SESSIONS.</p>
<p>In the case against Charles McInnes for not sending his ward J. McCallum Wilson aged 11 years,
to school Charles McInnes gave evidence and deposed that the boy came to his place the second
week in December, and he only had the opportunity of sending the lad for a week or a fortnight.
He was a cousin to Fred Wilson, the father of the boy. Wilson was working at the sugar beet
but he did know where he was at the present time. Constable Boulton informed the Bench that
the summons had been taken out on the suggestion of Sergeant Davies, of Sale.</p>
<p>Mr. Creswell: Information dismissed.</p>

<h3>Gippsland Times (Vic.) Monday 16 October 1899 p 3 Article</h3>
<p>At the Sale Police Court on Friday before Messrs. Johnstone and Harkness J's.P., Fred Wilson
was charged on bail with failing to maintain his lawful child Jessie. Mr Shain appeared for
Wilson. The child was in custody of Mrs. Hargreaves who was the informant in the case, a warrant
having been issued for Wilson on her information. The case was remanded from the 9th October,
with a view to a hearing before Mr. Cresswell, P..M., but as he did not attend the court on
Friday last it was decided to go on with it. Wilson now offered to take the child, and Mr
Shain, on his behalf, stated that one of the relatives of the accused had offered to look
after it. It was only in the power of the justices to order maintenance of a child, but they
could not even do that in this case in the face of the ruling of Chief Justice Stawell, which
he quoted, also citing the cases of McFarlane v. McFarlane, and McKenzie v. McKenzie. The
opinion of the learned judge in the latter case being that so long as the husband consented
to take the wife back, an order for maintenance cannot he made against him The bench asked
for an assurance that the accused's offer to maintain and take the child back was a bona fide
one. Mr Shain questioned Wilson and was answered in the affirmative, Mr Shain stating that
accused had been all over the town looking for somebody to take care of the child. He had
already provided for four children, but this being very young all his efforts had failed,
till at length one of his relatives had consented to take charge of it. The bench stated that
the reason the question of Wilson's bona fide was put was that the accused had not shown any
real disposition to maintain his child, and Sergt. Davies averred that in a former case of
the kind against Wilson he had made a similar promise. The bench gave him an opportunity to
provide for the child, and dismissed the case. Mrs Hargreaves (sister of accused) who has
had the care of the infant recently, having received it from another who had had charge of
it since the death of Wilson's wife about twelve months ago, asked that the 5s expended on
the warrant should be returned to her, but the justices could not make such an order, Mr.
Harkness saying, &quot;Surely Wilson will compensate the woman who looked after his child.&quot;</p>

<p>A DISTRESSING FATALITY</p>
<p>CHOKED WHILE AT TEA.</p>
<p>Sale, Tuesday.</p>
<p>A well known resident, Mr. John McCallum Wilson; met with a painfully sudden death; at his
residence, Square Forrest, near Sale on Monday night. He was sitting at tea with his wife
and children when he choked and fell back. All the efforts of Mrs. Wilson and the servants
to bring him to were unavailing, and Dr. Hagennauor was sent for from Sale, a considerable
distance away. When the doctor, arrived; the unfortunate man had expired. The cause of death
was a piece of corned beef getting into the larynx, At an inquiry today before Mr. Johnstone,
J. P. a. verdict according to the medical evidence was returned. The late Mr. Wilson who was
in comfortable circumstances leaves a widow and, three children.</p>

<p>BEFORE Messrs T. Johnstone, and J. Cullinan, J's.P., at the Sale Police Court on Friday, Isabella
Jessie McCallum Wilson, aged seven years, was charged with being a neglected child. Mrs. Elizabeth
Davidson, widow, of Sale, gave evidence that the child had been living with her nearly seven
years. The mother was dead, and the father, Fred Wilson, had arranged to pay the witness 7s
6d weekly for the child's maintenance; but during the whole time she had only received £2.
She saw the father for the last time four years ago, but did not know where he was now. She
had three children of her own to support, and on account of ill-health was not now able to
support Wilson's child. Senior-constable Noble told the bench that the father, Fred Wilson,
was a one-time resident of Sale, and was a worthless, good-for-nothing fellow. In asking for
a remand for a week, the senior-constable said it would give the police an opportunity of
finding &quot;this beauty of a father.&quot; The remand was granted, and the child handed
over to the care of Mrs. Davidson in the meantime.</p>
