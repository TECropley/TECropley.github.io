<h1>Pastoral Properties</h1>
<h2>Grazing on the Keilor-Werribee Plains</h2>
<h3>by GARY VINES</h3>

<p>Cropley's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truganina</p>
<p>Stoneleigh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle and Sinclair's Rd. Rockbank</p>
<p>c1850-1857&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cropley brothers</p>
<p>Stoneleigh is located on Sinclair's Road on the south bank of Kororoit Creek at Grid Ref.BU978208.
The original bluestone homestead and outbuildings were located on the south bank of Kororoit Creek but 
today the site is dominated by the turn-of-the-century timber farmhouse. The original cobbled driveway 
still leads to Sinclair's (formerly Hopkins) Road, which itself retains the bluestone cobbling constructed 
during the 1850s following the establishment of the first roads boards although recently covered in gravel 
and sand. The 1930s ordnance survey maps show several buildings, a windmill and dry stone walls on the 
property and also show dry stone walls surrounding the property, on all sides of Section 26 Lot C. 
The Cropley brothers, Benjamin, George, Effield, John, Samuel, and Henry Clay, first came to Australia 
in 1850. Certain of the brothers returned to their home county, Lincolnshire between 1851 and 57 but 
came back in 1857 to established a dairy and hay farm near the intersection of Middle and Sinclair's 
Roads, Rockbank which was eventually known as 'Stoneleigh'. The farm was on the Kororoit Creek and 
had once been part of the Rockbank Run. The parish Plans record H.S. Crossley as the purchaser at 
auction on 18 April 1852 but this is a misspelling for Henry Clay Cropley, the actual buyer. 
The mistake was later corrected on some plans. The brothers each selected 50 acre blocks on Greig's 
Road and leased other land, evidently from Clarke. The small size of the blocks was probably an 
indication of the limited means of the family as up to 640 acres could generally be selected.</p>

<p>The Cropleys also owned property in the Truganina district, part of which later became May Farm, 
which has been in the Evans family for four generations.</p>

<p>In order to make their farming operations more profitable, John Cropley ran a small mixed store, 
selling everything from ribbons to window sashes to local farmers. The brothers may also have continued 
the previous carting work which Ben had commenced during the gold rushes first with a draft horse which 
was stolen and then returned for the reward and later with a bullock team. Henry only occupied the property 
for about 10 years, leaving it in tragic circumstances as a consequence of an attack by the bushrangers 
Saunders and Johnson during his absence. The attacker tied up his pregnant wife while he raped a servant 
girl. </p>

<p>Some of the Cropley brothers selected land in Gippsland where they ran a dairy farm and unsuccessful 
sawmill. Walter Cropley carried on the family property early this century and there are still descendants 
of George Cropley resident in the Truganina district. Gwen Mosely lived on the Stoneleigh property in the 1930s.</p>

<h1>May Farm</h1>
<h2>485 Dohertys Road, Truganina</h2>
<p>location: (-37.828440°, 144.736055°)</p>

<p>The site is located down a long drive off Dohertys Road.  A shed, fence and plantings of trees 
are visible from the road.  The graves of Samuel and Henry Cropley are said to be located in a corner 
of the property.  The grave sites were once fenced, but are now cropped.  It is thought that they died 
during a diphtheria epidemic.</p>

<p>May Farm is important for its long associations with the Cropley’s, one of the most prominent Shire 
farming families.  According to the Truganina Parish Plan, the allotment was owned by B. E. Cropley as 
early as 1858.  The first Wyndham District Board 1863 records rated Benjamin and Effield Cropley for a 
315 acre farm at Truganina, comprising 250 acres under pasture and 65 acres under cultivation.  
This farm was identified in the middle 1880s as a 155 acre farm in Allotment 3 and a 159 acres farm in 
Allotment 2 of Section XVI, Parish of Truganina. George Cropley was leasing both properties from the Crown.  
The following year George was rated as the owner of both farms.  Today, the May Farm property stands on 
Allotment 3 of Section XVI.</p>

<p>The four Cropley brothers George, Benjamin, Effield and John were early Truganina farmers, all 
“early Baptist stalwarts” who married four Earle sisters.  An early Truganina school was run by 
Mrs. G. Cropley.</p>

<p>May Farm continued in Cropley ownership.  George Cropley Snr. was its owner in the late 1890s.  
By the turn of the century George and Walter Cropley shared the ownership of the 315 acre property 
with its farm homestead.  Walter Cropley was the sole owner in 1906 and at least until the end of 
the First World War.</p>

<p>The entrance drive from Dohertys Road to May Farm is marked on a 1915 Army Ordnance map, showing 
the property extending across the two allotments.  A later, 1933 Army map shows the property name 
“May Farm” near this drive.</p>

<p>It is said that Cropley descendants were living around Truganina in the 1960s.  There are reputedly 
some Cropley graves at May Farm, which were once fenced off near a corner of the property.</p>

<h1>DARNUM</h1>
<h2>A History of the School and District</h2>
<h2>1881 – 1981</h2>

<h4>PIONEER FAMILIES</h4>
<h4>Cropley:</h4>

<p>The name Cropley has been associated with the Darnum district almost
from its beginning. Benjamin and his brother Effield came from the Werribee
district in 1875, and selected land at Ellinbank. The brothers married sisters
and both had large families. Ben and his wife Elizabeth had eleven
children—Sarah, Fanny, Herbert, Jessie, Benjamin, Annie, Richard, Rose, James,
Daisy and Samuel. Effield’s family consisted of nine children: Effield, Marshall,
Grace, Frank, Felicia, Minnie, Ernest, Amelia and Polly. Some of the younger
children attended the Darnum School.</p>

<p>In March 1882, the brothers purchased a 310 acre property on the
west side of the Little Moe River between Darnum and Bloomfield (Nilma) from
Peter Miller for £939.3s. 9d. At the time of purchase, improvements to the
property consisted of: 220 acres under grasses, some of which were partially
overgrown again, fencing, which consisted of chock and log in fair order, a
house of four rooms with kitchen etc. and garden situated on the southern part
of the property and approximately 20 acres which had been under the plough.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 1" width=444 src="Ben%20Cropley%20and%20family%201902.jpg"
    alt="Ben Cropley and family 1902"/></p>

<p>The property was leased back to the Miller family until 1891 by
which time Ben had sole ownership of the farm and had moved his family in from
Ellinbank. Ben moved a second house of two rooms onto the northern part of the
property and added another four rooms using timber from their Gainsborough
mill. An additional 13 acres fronting the main Gippsland road were later added to
the farm which was named “Swaton Farm” after Ben’s home town in England. A
number of outbuildings were erected around the homestead, including one where
large quantities of cheese were made under the supervision of Miss Annie
Cropley. Cheese was made until about 1903 when the Bloomfield Co-operative
Butter and Cheese Factory commenced operations with Ben Cropley as one of the
original board of directors.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Cropley brothers established a sawmill in the Ellinbank
district and hauled the timber to the Darnum station along seven miles of iron
tramway using a steam locomotive imported from England.</p>

<p>The Darnum farm was split into three sections in 1912; the southern
portion with the original home being transferred to Effield’s son Frank who
later sold to James Sargeant in 1922. The remaining portion was divided between
Ben’s sons, Jim and Sam who worked in partnership for many years. Milk
production improved in the 1930s with the introduction of pedigree Guernsey
cattle. Another significant improvement occurred in 1938 when, after years of
negotiation the S.E.C. connected electricity to the property. Jim Cropley’s
farm was transferred to his son Ben who sold it in 1976 to John Woods who
resold in 1980 to Milton Roberts, the present owner. Sam’s farm was passed on
to his son Ray who still farms the property.</p>

<p>Ben Cropley Senior was very active in community affairs and
represented the ratepayers of the South Riding of the Shire of Warragul, was a
member of the provisional committee of the Warragul Agricultural Society in
1885 and was also on the first Board of Advice for the school district of
Warragul which included the Darnum School. He was one of the inaugural members
of the Darnum Hall Committee and actively involved in church activities until
his death in 1926 at the age of 91.</p>

<p>In 1906, Effield Samuel, eldest son of Effield Cropley, also
purchased a farm at Darnum located on the east side of the Little Moe River
across from Ben’s farm. Effield Samuel worked this property until 1930 when it
was managed by his brother Frank until his death and then by other members of
the family. In 1943 it was sold to Arthur Hallett; then eventually managed by
his son Jack. Max Crawford acquired it in 1964 and still farms this property.</p>

<h1>BLOOMFIELD AND BEYOND</h1>
<h2>A History of Nilma 1885 -1985</h2>
<h3>by Eileen M. Williams</h3>

<h3>FAMILIES</h3>
<h4>CROPLEY</h4>

<p>Lured by the prospect of rich farmland in the district surrounding Brandy Creek, Ben
Cropley, together with two other family members journeyed eastward from the
Werribee district in 1875. From Brandy Creek they travelled south to what is
now known as Ellinbank where they selected five blocks and began the unenviable
task of clearing away the dense forest.</p>

<p>In 1882 Ben saw potential in a 310 acre property owned by Peter Miller at Bloomfield
(Allotment 110) and negotiated its purchase in March of that year. At the time
of purchase the property, situated on the western side of the Little Moe River
contained 220 acres which had already been sown down and fenced, however this
had become partially overgrown again. Another 25 acres had been under the
plough with the balance presumably still in its original state. A modest house
of four rooms, a kitchen and garden complimented the purchase. Ben did not
immediately occupy the property, preferring to lease it for a time while he
remained at Ellinbank.</p>

<p>In 1890 he moved a second house of two rooms onto the northern part of the property and
added another four rooms using timber from the Cropley’s sawmilling enterprise
at Gainsborough. Ben then brought his wife Jane and nine children (Sarah,
Fanny, Jessie, Annie, Richard, Rose, James, Daisy and Samuel) to the Bloomfield
farm which he named “Swaton” after the Cropley’s home town in Lincolnshire,
England from where he emigrated in 1852. Several outbuildings were subsequently
erected including one where quantities of cheese were made under the
supervision of Annie Cropley. Cheese was made until 1903 when the Bloomfield
Co¬operative Butter and Cheese Factory commenced operations with Ben Cropley
being elected as one of the original directors. In the following year he was
elected Chairman of Directors. Ben maintained an active involvement in this
enterprise through his directorship up until November 1921 at least, when he
was again elected unopposed at the grand age of 86.</p>

<p>In 1912 Ben split “Swaton” into three sections with the southern portion containing the original
house being transferred to a nephew, Frank Cropley who, in 1922, sold it to the
Sargeant family, the present owners. The remainder was divided between Ben’s
sons, Jim and Sam who worked in partnership for many years. Jim and Sam married
sisters from the Crawford family. Jim and his wife Emma lived in the homestead
property while Sam and his wife Annie lived in a third house erected on his
property which was named “Morella”. Now that the day to day running of the farm
was in good hands Ben purchased a boarding house in Warragul where he lived in
retirement with his unmarried daughters Jessie, Annie and Rose.</p>

<p>Following Jim’s death in 1947 his property was passed down to his son Benjamin John. Ben
married Gladys Bounds and had a daughter Marjorie and sons Daryl and Stuart all
of whom attended the Nilma school. Ben and Glad were also involved with school
activities during this period with Ben serving as President of the school committee
from 1958-64. In 1962 Ben erected a new house and continued farming until 1976
when ill health forced him to sell his property.</p>

<p>Sam’s property was transferred to his son Ray who married Janet McGilp and had 
daughters Megan and Barbara and a son Howard. Both girls had a keen interest in 
the Nilma netball team while Howard concentrated on his
football. Tennis was a common interest in the summer months. Both Ray and Jan
became involved in school affairs during their childrens’ attendance at the
Nilma school. Ray also served for many years on the Committee of Management of
the Recreation Reserve at Darnum, the home ground for the Nilma-Darnum Football
Club. Ray still farms his 123 acre property fronting onto the recently
duplicated highway thus maintaining the Cropley name in his portion of the
original holding.</p>

<p>In May, 1907, Ben bought 130 acres of Ned Elliott’s property to the west of the Bloomfield
township (Allotments 63 &amp; 64) and moved a house onto it from the Bloomfield
township using bullocks. This property was purchased for his eldest son Richard
who was then farming the original selection at Ellinbank while the Bloomfield
house was occupied by his sister Fanny who had been widowed with five children.
The land was farmed by Jim and Sam who grazed their young stock from the “Swaton”
farm.</p>

<p>When the Ellinbank farm was sold in 1920 Richard moved to his Bloomfield farm and Fanny
purchased a house in Warragul. However, when the construction of outbuildings
was contemplated it was found that the land adjacent to the house was not
suitable for their erection so the house was again moved a short distance south
to its present position. Richard continued to farm the property along with his
son Graham until 1970 when it was sold to John and Shirley Patrick, the present
owners of the property.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 2" src="Ben%20Cropley%20&%20family%201902.jpg" alt="Ben Cropley & family 1902"/></p>

<p>Ben Cropley also took an active interest in a variety of community affairs. In 1884 he was
elected as a Councillor of the Shire of Warragul and in 1885 was a member of
the provisional committee of the Warragul and West Gippsland Agricultural
Society which made arrangements for the staging of Warragul’s first
Agricultural Show. Ben’s wider interest in the farming community also involved
him in the Nilma branch of the Victorian Farmers’ Union where he held the
position of Vice President in 1917. In addition, he was actively involved in
community affairs at Darnum as well as having a long association with the
Methodist Church in Warragul.</p>

<p>Ben died at his Connor Street residence in 1926 at the age of 91 years.</p>

<h4>SMITH</h4>

<p>Joseph Smith had the Bloomfield Sawmill and Tramway Company, which was by far the largest
sawmill to work the forest around Bloomfield. In 1883 Joseph Smith moved his
mill from Warragul and re-sited it on the selection of R. W. Judd, a little
over a mile north east of Bloomfield. At first he hauled his timber over roads
to the town but in 1885 following a particularly wet winter he laid a tramway
to the station and continued to work this until 1888 when he shifted the mill
to Ellinbank, five miles to the south.</p>

<h1>ELLINBANK</h1>
<h2>1874 – 1974</h2>
<h3>by the Centenary of Ellinbank Committee</h3>

<p class='offset'>“In each others faces,<br/>
Looked the Pioneers,<br/>
They drank the wine of courage<br/>
All their battle years.<br/>
For their weary sowing<br/>
Through the wold wide.<br/>
Green they saw the harvest<br/>
Ere the day they died.”</p>

<p>In writing this story of the first 100 years of settlement at Ellinbank. tribute must be
paid to the pioneer men and women who came to the virgin forest area to the
South of Warragul (meaning “wild”), when it was opened up in the 1870’s, We who
reap the rewards of their labour, can only guess at the trials and hardships
that were encountered and overcome during those early years. Few nowadays would
attempt what these stalwart pioneers accomplished with only the aid of axes,
cross-cut saws, maul and wedges, and the ever reliable horse. The dense forest was
transformed into one of the richest and most fertile dairying districts in the Australian
Commonwealth, Homes were built, roads made, and Ellinbank became the prosperous
and picturesque district it is today, situated beneath Mt. Worth (the highest
point in the Strzelecki Ranges) aptly named after one of the early pioneers.
Richard Worth, who settled there in 1878, May we be worthy of the heritage they
have handed down to us. —</p>

<p class='offset'>“Forward adventuring, knowing no fears —<br />
Honor and praise to the old Pioneers.”</p>

<p>They came in drays or on pack horses as far as Drouin, turned south along Lardner’s Track,
then east up the blazed track (Blaze’s) to get to their blocks. There was only
a bridle track through the forest with trees two to three hundred feet in
height on either side, and almost impenetrable undergrowth of hazel-trees, musk,
supple-jack and tree ferns up to 15 feet high. Rising early each morning, the
settlers cut scrub all day, just taking time off when the sun was overhead for
a bite of lunch. The men kept working to keep warm, because with every stroke of
the axe, water from the branches above would descend upon them. It was always
wet and cold in the forest owing to the height of the trees and the denseness
of the undergrowth. The settlers lived in huts made from roughly cut timber and
bark, which could not be erected until a patch of timber had been cleared.
Native bears, (from which Bear Creek derives its name) dingoes and wallabies
were plentiful in the area. Provisions had to be brought on pack horses from
Brandy Creek about five miles the other side of Warragul, The terms offered by
the Government to purchasers of the 320 acre blocks were very liberal — £1 (one
pound) per acre, with a three year residence clause, and seven years in which
to pay — this was later extended to fourteen years.</p>

<h4>Early Settlers</h4>

<p>Our first known settler was John Hardie (1874) whose family came from Berwickshire (Scotland).
He selected at the eastern end of Blaze’s Track (now Tackaberry’s). John Hardie
and his wife. Ellen, had a daughter, Margaret, who later became the wife of
Gus. Topp and the mother of well-known district resident, Mrs Doris Gilbert,
Ellen Hardie died in 1875, when her son Alex. was born. Later John Hardie re-married
and had five more children, the eldest of whom, Isabella, married Ernest
Cropley — their family lived in the district for many years. When John Hardie
died in 1894, part of his farm was sold to G. Edwards, his family remaining on
the other part of the block for some years before selling to W.0. MacPherson (later
J. Mann’s, now S. Costello’s), John Hardie named his property “Ellen Bank” after
his first wife, and it was at his home that the first Post Office was opened.
After some years, however, when the Post Office was moved to David Smith’s property
(later W. Kingston’s and now part of the Dairy Research Station) people had
formed the habit of putting “Ellen Bank” on their letters, and when the Post
Office, in error, made its stamp “Ellinbank” there was much confusion with the
district eventually becoming known as “Ellinbank”.</p>

<p>Ben Cropley was born at Quadring in Lincolnshire; at the age of 17, he arrived in Melbourne
to join three brothers who came out in 1850, After carting to the goldfields
for a time, Ben and his brothers bought land on the Werribee plains. In 1875,
they heard about Brandy Creek from Mr Harkness, and that year Ben Cropley and
his brother Effield came to Warragul South with their three nephews, William
aged 19 and John 17, both sons of John Cropley, and Alfred, <span class='query'>son of George Cropley</span>,
In later years. Crosby, Charles and Percy Cropley, who were brothers of William
and John also came to Warragul South.</p>

<p>In Ben’s own words, taken from an interview by the Warragul Gazette 1926 — “We left our horses
in Hann’s paddock and carried our swags and food out to a store and post office
on Lardner’s Track, kept by Mrs Symes, and thought they were the longest miles
we had ever travelled. We stayed the night there and next day made for a
surveyor’s camp on John Hardie’s selection, where we borrowed a compass from
one of the men. John Hardie came with us, and we took axes to blaze the track
and cut the scrub for about two and a half miles — when it was surveyed later,
our line was only about three feet out! By 1877, we had about 100 acres of scrub
cut. and after burning off and picking up the small timber, we were ready to
sow grass seed on the ashes. However, before we could get the seed, we had to
corduroy two boggy flats and build two bridges over creeks. It cost 15/- per
acre to pick up and clear the land ready for sowing, and about the same for
seed. We put on 600 sheep and soon after had them shorn. Then caterpillars
came, ate all the grass and left it as bare as if the land had never been sown,
so the sheep had to live off the scrub until we could sell them. When the grass
came again in the Autumn, we bought some cows and dairy heifers intending to go
in for cheese-making in the Spring, but the caterpillars again ate out the grass
and we had to put the cattle out to graze. We had the same experience four
years following. Soon after, we bought the heifers, pleuro broke out and we
lost quite a few. The rest were inoculated, and after a while we got rid of the
disease.”</p>

<p>William John Dalgleish was born at Prince Edwards Island, North America, and was. a school teacher
in South Australia before coming to Warragul South about 1875. He made a
specialty of growing strawberries, and at one time is reported to have had ten
acres under cultivation. He selected 312 acres known as “Fernleigh Farm” (now
J. James), </p>

<p>Topp brothers. Gus and John, who were born at Woodstock (Vic) came about 1880, and leased land
from A. Baker (now Geo. Abel’s), where the family lived for a time in a hollow
tree. Later they purchased 314 acres from G. Fry, an original settler, for six
pounds per acre (now A. Fraser’s and J. Farthing’s). Topp Bros, became our
first door-to-door butchers, cutting up a beast and selling to nearby settlers.
John Topp, who became one of the district’s earliest councillors, married Ben
Cropley’s daughter, Fanny; brother Gus, as mentioned earlier, married Maggie Hardie.
Both brothers died when still relatively young men — Mrs G. Topp sold to G.
Fraser in 1908, son Alex. still farms the property.</p>

<p>William Pascoe was born in Lincoln. England and went to New Zealand before coming to Warragul
South about 1876. He had one of the first traction engines in the district to
work his threshing and chaff-cutting plant (property later Bert. Mann’s, now
Andy Jupp’s).</p>

<p>Frank Walkden was an early settler and neighbour of W. J. Dalgleish who also went in for
extensive growing of strawberries as well as dairy fanning. (E. O’Mahoney’s,
now S. Winterton and B. Stevens).</p>

<p>John S. Cropley, born at Rockbank
(Vic.) in 1858 and came to Warragul South in 1875, Selected 320 acres on the
corner of Hazeldean Road and what is now Cropley’s Road. His property is the
only originally selected land in the area still being held by the family. The homestead
block is farmed by his son John. John S. Cropley sold part of his block to his brother,
Crosby, who farmed there until his death in 1946, and is now owned by his son Marshall.
Charles, another brother of J.S. worked the remaining area for a time (now T.
Hinton’s), East of John S. Cropley was his brother William’s 320 acre block,
where the Gainsborough mill was located. He farmed there for many years, before
selling to F. B. Henderson (later W. J. Reid, now B. Blackshaw and R. Telford).
East of William Cropley was his cousin, Alfred, who later sold and went to
America (now E. Wallace, R. Anderson and I. Savige). To the south of William Cropley
was his uncle Ben Cropley’s block. He originally selected on the Gainsborough
flats, but found them too wet, sold to J. Davis, and bought land further back
in the hills (now W. Paynter and B. Gaul) where he farmed for years before moving
to Darnum. South of John S. Cropley was his uncle Effield, who lived there for
some time, and upon his death, his son Ernest farmed there for many years
before selling to J. McCaffery in 1945. (Known as Campbell’s and recently bought
by William M. Cropley). — Part of this block was earlier bought by J. Hammill.
Ben Cropley’s eldest son, Herbert, who was killed at the age of 15 by a falling
tree, was buried on the property, as was Effield’s daughter. Polly, who died at
four years of age.</p>

<p>Another early settler was David Smith, from Wales, who became the first Councillor for Warragul
South. In 1879, he gave one acre of land to the Education Department for the
site of the school, and later donated the land on which the Warragul South Church
was built (later known as the Methodist Church). Mr W. C. Kingston bought the
property from Mr Smith in 1895.</p>

<p>Joseph Smith selected where Arthur Mann later lived. He was an authority on sowing and mixing
grass-seed, and his services were much in demand. His block was worked by his
son William, who had a large saw mill in the area. (Now part of the Ellinbank
Research Station). Another son, John, also farmed in the district for quite
some time.</p>

<p>William Wallace and his son David, came from Dunmunkle in the Wimmera in 1886. David Wallace’s
home was destroyed in one of the bush fires in the area, and he re-built across
the road, naming his property “Daisy Bank.” He owned the first reaper and
binder in the district. His son Harry in later years, acquired his grand-father
William’s property (then Facey’s) where his son Tom now farms, while his elder
son William works an adjoining farm. Harry Wallace was a foundation member of
many of our sporting bodies, and his sons carry on the tradition.</p>

<p>William C. Kingston came to Ellinbank in 1895 and gave great service to the district and community
for many years. He served as a South Riding Councillor from 1922-49, a record
term of office, being President on three occasions. He married Miss Catherine
Murdie, daughter of another pioneer, Henry Murdie. Mr Kingston’s property is
now part of the Ellinbank Dairy Research Station.</p>

<p>Colonel George Stephens lived with his twin sisters on a property originally owned by E. B. Hamilton
(now B. Gaul’s) before acquiring the farm on the South Road known as “Merton” (R.
Addison). Later the Hon. Michael Scott also resided where Mr Bruce Gaul now
lives. George Edwards was one of the earliest settlers, and sold to Christopher
Tackaberry about 1895. His grandson, William Tackaberry, is still farming in
the district (portion of the land is owned by A. Pratt).</p>

<p>William H. Paynter came to the district from Echuca in 1900 on to a property originally
owned by Dr. L. Travers. Mr Paynter was a Shire Councillor from 1912-16. and
1920-24. being Shire President 1915-16. One son, Bert, still resides on part of
the property. Another son, Ernest, also farmed in the district for many years,
the property now being owned by his son W. Paynter. The youngest son, Gordon,
was a shire councillor from 1949-54, and had the distinction of being Shire
President during the Queen’s visit to Warragul in 1953, His son Trevor now
farms the property.</p>

<p>William Marshall and his family came in 1900, also buying from L. Travers, This
property was divided between the two sons David and William, David leaving the
district after some time farming the section now owned by C. Mclnnes, but
William Marshall was a well-known resident for more than 60 years (now Rod,
Abel’s)</p>

<p>George A. Heywood came from Benalla in 1896, and bought part of the Tetoora Estate, where his son
Alex still resides. In early years his family was closely associated with the Ellinbank
School and Church, and his descendants are still well-known in the surrounding districts.</p>

<p>Thomas Bird and his family were associated with the early life of the community and its social
activities (now W. Keeble). </p>

<p>William Kelly came to the area about 1901, later marrying Miss Hunt, a daughter of William Hunt,
who at one time was manager of Nestor’s Butter Factory at Bull Swamp, Mr Cecil
Kelly, a son, still lives on the property.</p>

<p>Mrs A. V. Love was an original selector (W. Barrett’s and J. Feehan’s), who sold to William McFarland.
His son, Stuart, was lost in the bush when a small child, with the whole
neighbourhood searching for him. The scrub was very dense, but the boy was
found safe and well after two or three days of searching, William McFarland was
Shire President 1902-3, He sold to Lionel Gilbert (one of three brothers) in
1905 and moved to another property at Seaview on McDonald’s Track, (it is not
generally known that G. T. McDonald, in 1862, surveyed a track along the ridge
of the Strzelecki Ranges for the purpose of finding a better stock route from
East Gippsland to Melbourne — cattle from the big East Gippsland stations
travelled north of Brandy Creek en route to Melbourne, the journey taking up to
two weeks. Unfortunately for McDonald, there was no permanent water along the
track and it was unsuitable as a stock route. Today, travellers along the Grand
Ridge Road will come to sections of the road that are marked on maps of the
area as “McDonald’s Track”).</p>

<p>Lionel Gilbert and his family were well-known residents, living on the property known as “Thornhill”
for many years (Now J. Feehan’s).</p>

<p>Ellis Gilbert bought from John Rodda, who came in 1897, Ellis sold to his nephew A. H. (Hal.)
Gilbert, whose family still reside on the property. Basil Gilbert purchased
land from McMillan’s and resided there for some years, later E. Harlow’s, now
Carroll Bros.</p>

<p>Henry Murdie bought 120 acres from Parkes Bros. m 1897, and a further 320 acres from Michael
Scott (now W. Pratt’s and G. Pratt’s. A. Jones) . On his eastern boundary was
A. F. S. Wright (Wright’s Road), who married a daughter of Chas, Rowands, an
engineer with the Roads and Bridges Dept., who selected land further north.</p>

<p>William Johnston and his family were associated with Ellinbank for many years. Johnston
Bros. (Bob and Norman) were well-known farming contractors for chaff-cutting
and ploughing, etc. (R. Kenny’s). Opposite them was W. Astle. who married a
daughter of Frank Walkden (D. Pratt’s).</p>

<h3>HISTORIAN’S NOTE</h3>

<p class='offset'>Our historian has been very conscious of the fact that a considerable portion of the “Early
Settlers” section has been devoted to the Cropley family — however, when it is
realised that, of the relatively small number of pioneers, eight were Cropleys.
it is obvious it could not be otherwise, if a true record were to be made.</p>

<p>As is usual in pioneering history, we have records of the deeds and accomplishments of many of
the men who founded our district, yet how little we know of the loneliness and
heartbreak of the women who toiled with their menfolk. Their home for years was
a rough hut made from bark and .slab timber. Many raised large families in the
isolation of the bush, milked cows by hand, made butter, baked bread in camp-ovens,
carted water, and often followed behind the horse and plough. Snakes were
plentiful, and a hazard with little children running about. At the turn of the
century. Indian hawkers came around to the farm houses, first carrying their wares
in packs on their backs and later with hawker’s carts, selling needles and cotton,
and various small articles and materials the housewife needed. It is reported
that some of those pioneer women did not leave their farm sites for over twelve
months at a time — who can tell just what it meant to them when they were able to
go to the local church and the social functions that were held there — to be
able to talk with other women and share their problems. At Ellinbank, the
Sunday School Anniversary and the tea-meeting and concert that followed during the
week were a highlight of the year.</p>
<p>Every mother knows the fear that strikes when
a child suddenly becomes ill — on one occasion, when a child was ill, the
mother had to catch and saddle a horse to take her little one to the doctor,
but sad to say, the child died in her arms before she reached there — she could
only ride on to the doctor’s!</p>

<p class='offset'>“For them no trumpet sounds the call.<br />
No poet plies his arts —<br />
They only hear the beating of their<br />
gallant loving hearts;<br />
But they have sung with silent lives.<br />
the song all songs above —<br />
The holiness of sacrifice.<br />
The dignity of love.”</p>

<h4>Sawmills</h4>

<p>Several sawmills operated in the area and in 1887, Cropleys put in the Gainsborough
mill on W. T. Cropley’s block, and ran seven miles of tram-line straight
through to Darnum Railway Station, with 60 lbs. iron rails bought from the
Railways at £4-10-0 per ton. They also imported a locomotive made by Fowler of
Leeds, (England) to pull the timber trolleys. William Smith laid the tram-lines
and the whole plant cost in the vicinity of £6000. Experienced bushmen felled
the tress which were then sawn into lengths and snigged to the mill by horse or
bullock teams. The mill turned out all sizes of timber, according to market
demands. Some wonderful Blackwood, Messmate, Black-butt and Swamp Gum timber
was taken out from the surrounding areas. The tall trees in the forest produced
many “tall” stories, which could not be verified, however, what was known as
the “Thorpdale” tree was measured by surveyors at 375 feet. Undoubtedly there
were some trees that exceeded even that in length. The mills output was about
4,000 super feet per day with timber bringing from 5/- to 7/6 per 100 feet.
Timber sent away exceeded 1,000 tons per month. The staff of 24 were paid about
5/- per ten hour day. The output from William Smith’s mill nearby was between
8,000 and 9,000 feet per day, worked with 16 men. In answer to questions
regarding difference in output. Smith said he kept his men going and was never
afraid of a fight when the men protested! From figures he supplied to the Lands
Department, timber sold from his father’s 320 acre block (now part of the Dairy
Research Station) realized £32,000 on the open market. The tram-lines,
privately constructed for the Cropley mill carried the output of other mills in
the area, and were also used by paling splitters and timber-getters, as there
was no other way of transporting timber to the railway station, particularly in
the winter months. Some employees had their families with them, so rough buildings
were erected near the mill. The mill plant was roofed, and stabling erected for
the horses, and quite a settlement sprang up in the vicinity of the mill, which
was an important industry in those early days. About twice a week, a younger
member of the Cropley family rode into Darnum for the mail, taking all day for
the trip, which in winter-time was a night-mare, the track being so wet and
boggy, the mud came up to the horse’s belly, causing the hair to come off the
animal’s legs. Leeches attached themselves to man and beast. Gainsborough mill
ceased operations in 1900.</p>

<p>In 1901, William Smith, sawmiller and member of the Warragul Racing Club, offered to
supply free of charge and delivered to Darnum Railway Station all the timber
necessary to build a grand-stand at the Warragul race course to accommodate 500
people. This was gratefully accepted, and the grandstand was erected and used
for a number of years before it was considered unsafe and was demolished. It is
interesting to note that a movement to establish a public hospital at Warragul
originated in the 1880’s because of the number of accidents that occurred at
the sawmills and amongst the timber. Subscriptions were generous, and a
Government grant enabled the first section of the present hospital to be
erected.</p>

<h4>Roads and Quarries</h4>

<p>The roads in the area were appalling. Passing through the forest with tall trees on either
side, the tracks went down into the gullies and straight up the other side, so
neither sun nor wind could get in to dry the muddy tracks. A copious rainfall
made them almost impassable. As far back as 1886, the Warragul Council
investigated the possibility of constructing tram lines in the Warragul South
area and of borrowing £26,000 for the work. The ratepayers turned against the
proposal and the scheme fell through. In 1904, John S. Cropley sent to the council
a copy of a letter he had received from them in 1884. in respect to a deviation
of the road near his property (now Cropley’s Road). He “thought that 20 years
was sufficient time for them to consider the matter, and that something should
be done.” Cr. Tom Strickland of Gainsborough worked hard within the council to
have roads attended to, and in 1909 a stone crusher was purchased, there being
a good supply of stone on Ben Cropley’s farm at Ellinbank (now W. Paynter’s).
Unfortunately, the stone-crusher gave considerable trouble and was eventually scrapped.
When the Country Roads Board came into existence in 1913 (originating in
Warragul), considerable quantities of metal were taken from the same quarry for
use on local roads and also in the building of the Warragul theatre. When the
council undertook the construction of the Warragul - Leongatha Road, the
contractors (Eckberg Bros.) constructed an aerial tramway to convey the metal
across the gullies to the Seaview Road. To the delight of the residents, the first
council construction in 1913 was one of the sections of the Bear Creek -
Seaview Road. The contract was let to L. Malady and Kelly for £597. Other
sections were carried out by A. H. Mann, then a well-known district resident.
Laurence Malady and his sons carried out many road contracts throughout
Gippsland when the Country Roads Board commenced operations. </p>

<p>It is a far cry from our modern road networks to the almost impassable bridle tracks
through the forest of yester-year, and recognition must be made of the very
real contribution of the road-workers and various contractors. Almost all road
work was done by pick and shovel, with horse-drawn scoops and drays. Cartage of
metal and sand was done with horse wagons, generally with a five or six yard
capacity. It may be of interest to recall that the workers on the project using
the aerial tramway (which came from a disused coal mine from New South Wales)
staged what must have been one of our very earliest strikes — they-demanded an
increase in their pay and succeeded in obtaining an extra two shillings per
day.</p>

<p>Sand is still being taken from the pits in the Ellinbank area — Walkinshaw’s sand-washing enterprise
supplies a great part of the raw materials for local contractors in the
building industry, and large quantities of sand used by the Warragul Shire is
taken from Mr A. Peters’ pit.</p>

<p>Some names of early contractors and carriers come to mind:- Malady and Sons, Gallagher Bros.
(Brownie and Ock.); Fred Reeves and his son Chub; Norman Johnston, John Quinn,
Greg. Keating, and Alex and Jim Brown.</p>

<h4>Creameries</h4>

<p>The work of clearing the land was hard and slow, and much flat country needed draining before
it could be worked at all. Here the settlers came upon one of nature’s oddities
— the giant earth-worm (the world’s largest). They live in long winding burrows
that contain quantities of mud and water — this explains the loud gurgling sounds
which are sometimes heard when people walk across the flats.</p>

<p>As the land was brought into production, dairying was started — at first a few cows were milked
by hand and the milk set in tin pans in a nearby cooling room which was often a
hut built of logs. The cream was skimmed from the top of the milk, and on
certain days was put in the “Cherry Churner,” (this was bolted to the floor or
wall) and churned into butter. This was then patted into one pound prints, and
packed in specially made butter-boxes and transported by pack-horse to the
nearest centre. At first this was Brandy Creek, and later the butter was sent to
what has been referred to as the first butter factory in the State — Nestor’s
at Bull Swamp, opened in 1888. There the butter was sold for 3½d. to fourpence
per pound. At the first Warragul Agricultural Show in 1885, W. T. Cropley
received first prize for his butter, and continued to show successfully on many
occasions. Shortly, the Chilled Butter Factory opened a depot near the bridge
over Bear Creek on the Seaview Road, with Alex. Mackrell as manager. About this
time the hand separator was introduced, and farmers sledged their milk to the
depot to be separated, returning with the skim milk to feed to their pigs and
calves. In time farmers had their own separators and the horse-drawn creamery
wagons came out from Warragul factories twice weekly to pick up the cream and
bring much needed supplies and provisions for the farmers. What a wonderful boom
to the dairy farmer was the milking machine, enabling more cows to be milked in
a shorter time. So, the creamery wagon gave way to modern motor vehicles that
transported the cans to Warragul, and the era of “whole-milk to Melbourne” had
begun. In the present days of stainless-steel tankers and refrigerated farm vats,
with thousands of gallons of milk pouring into local factories, it is hard to
imagine the beginnings of the dairying industry in our district.</p>

<h4>Bushfires</h4>

<p>February 1898 saw a most disastrous fire sweep through Gippsland. The area to the South of
Warragul was still heavily timbered and with the settlers clearing and “burning
off,” it only needed the right conditions for the holocaust that was to follow.
It was such an inferno that the sky seemed to be a mass of flame, and many thought
the last day had come. Great logs many feet in diameter were reduced to ashes
and it was said that hardly a fence (log fences) was left for miles. The late
Mrs Fawcett (Wallace) was only a school-girl at the time, but recalled that “The
fires were burning in the timber for several days, and I remember Dad cutting
the fence to let a neighbor’s cattle out of the scrub. Then it rained, and the
fires were quiet for two or three days, but lots of trees were still burning.
We had the thresher at the time, with a stack of straw in the yard. A strong
north wind was blowing and it was very hot. I had to watch the sparks from a
nearby tree, but the fire came so fast there was no time to do anything. It
came through the dry grass across the road and the stack and sheds were gone.
Mother said the men on the thresher saved the house. We lost some of our pigs
when they rushed back into the sty. The fire went many miles that day,
spreading terror and destruction. There were no lives lost in our district, but
at night some poor singed wallabies came to the house looking for a drink.”</p>

<p>People were almost blinded by smoke and nearly demented by the ordeal through which they
had passed. It was a crushing blow to the settlers who had expended years of
toil on their holdings that were now blackened ruins.</p>

<p>Though there was terrible loss and destruction, the fire cleaned up many blocks in two days
that otherwise would have taken years to clear.</p>

<h4>CHURCHES</h4>

<p>In 1881. a small church was erected by voluntary labour on land donated by David Smith,
next door to the school. It was known as the Warragul South Church, the
original trustees being David Smith, Phillip Smith, Effield Cropley and John S.
Cropley. Later the church was extended and a platform erected. The building
became the centre of district functions, with church services, tea-meetings, school
concerts, debates and socials being held there. Of the official opening we have
no record, only a few books bearing the inscription — “Sth. Warragul
Congregational Library, Presented by Rev. W. R. Wade 1881”. The first
wedding, on Christmas Eve 1881, was that of W. T. Cropley and Miss Fanny Smith.
(Mrs Bertha Heywood. who was the last person to be buried from this church
(1969) was a daughter of Mr and Mrs W. T. Cropley).</p>

<p>Although known as the Methodist Church, it was in fact undenominational, and it was only in
1934, when John S. Cropley was the only remaining trustee, that the building
was signed over to the Methodist Church, and as such it remained until the
Anglican-Methodist Cooperating Church of St. Luke’s was opened in 1971.
Ministers to have served in the circuit include the Reverends Horton Williams,
R. A. Taylor, C. W. Atkinson, W. J. Williamson, Alex. Hay, A. E. Wellard, L. S.
S. Saunders, E. J. Hately, C. Turner, L. Wilkinson, Percy Smith, W. Hunkin, D.
Risstrom, H. Bock, J. Richards and N. Marshall. (J. S. Cropley was a local preacher
for 58 years).</p>

<h4>St. George’s Church of England</h4>

<p>By 1914, sufficient Anglicans had settled in the district to wish to build their own
church, and a committee was formed towards this object. In the meanwhile, Rev.
Nancarrow was to take services monthly at Mr W. C. Kingston’s home. The
committee was comprised of Messrs Kingston, Parnell, B. Gilbert, Tackaberry,
Hale, Scerecher and H. Wallace. Mr Lionel Gilbert donated land on the corner of
Korumburra and Ellinbank Roads, and the church was built by Mr Kent (builder)
and Mr Stoflers (plumber), assisted by voluntary labour. The church was officially
opened on 15th September, 1915 by the first Bishop of Gippsland, Dr. A. W.
Pain, assisted by the Rector of Warragul, Reverend L. M. Nancarrow. The first
organists were Miss M. Brasier and Miss P. Gilbert. It is recorded that the
first wedding was that of Mr John Webb and Miss Smith. To Mr Bill Wallace,
local sporting identity, goes the honour of being the first child baptised at
St. George’s. Other early names associated with the church include W. Potts, L.
and E. Gilbert, C. Sutherland, MacPherson, Warne, W. Pascoe and Parker. As with
the Methodist Church, the annual effort at St. George’s was the tea-meeting and
concert, and during the 1914-18 war, the church was used for patriotic
purposes. Under Rev. Nancarrow, a strong choir was built up, of which Mr Colin Sutherland
was later choir-master. As funds permitted, further work was carried out on the
building, the sanctuary being panelled and the porch completed in 1935. Other
ministers who served at St. George’s include Reverend P. W. Robinson,
Archdeacon Weir, F. Miller, W. K. Kenna, C. Woodhouse, S. Ball, Rev. W.
Clayton, T. Gee, Rev. A. E. Clark, R. J. Stockdale, R. Elliot, and W. Burchill.
Though ministers came and went, the church officials remained the same, and it
was after 30 years as church secretary that Mr Hal. Gilbert resigned in 1973, and
Mr Crick Tackaberry had been church treasurer for 25 years when he resigned in
1965. This was the year of the wonderful Golden Jubilee celebration, when
former parishioners and clergy renewed old acquaintances — little did they
realise that less than three years later on June 10th, 1968, on a cold winter’s
night, St. George’s would be burnt to the ground.</p>

<h4>St. Luke’s (Anglican-Methodist) Co-operating Church</h4>

<p>Following the destruction of St. George’s; discussions were held between the Anglicans and Methodists
of Ellinbank and Tetoora Road, with the view of building a co-operating church.
These discussions were helped by the close cooperation between Reverend Ray
Elliot (Anglican) and Reverend John Richards (Methodist) who were the
respective ministers at the time. It was decided to erect a brick church on the
site of St. George’s, the new church to be known as St. Luke’s
Anglican-Methodist Co-operating Church. The sum of $8,000 was raised by local
contributions and on March 28th, 1971, the new church (erected by L. McDonald, of
Warragul at a cost of $26,000) was officially opened by the Bishop of
Gippsland, Right Reverend D. Garnsey, assisted by the President of the
Methodist Conference of Victoria and Tasmania, Reverend H. MacKay and Reverends
Ray Elliot, J. Richards and N. Marshall.</p>

<p>On 4th June, 1971, St. Luke’s also was destroyed by fire. Worship was carried on once again
in the old Methodist Church, until St. Luke’s was rebuilt and opened for services
on 5th December 1971. By the end of 1973 it was officially declared free of
debt. The first wedding held in St. Luke’s was that of Jack Elliott and Miss
Lorna Worth.</p>

<p class='mid'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Both earlier churches had been greatly assisted by Ladies’ Guilds, which not only attended
to church cleaning, flowers, etc. but actively supported City Missions, Babies
Homes and other welfare organisations. St. Luke’s Ladies Guild now combines in
all these efforts most successfully. Highlight of the fund-raising efforts have
been the wonderful garden parties held in Mrs and Mr Geoff Savige’s lovely
garden —these have substantially helped in paying off the church building fund.</p>

<h4>Sunday Schools</h4>

<p>The earliest records we have of the Sunday School in this district begin in October 1895, when
Mr John Searle Cropley was named as Superintendent of the Warragul South Sunday
School. The following officers and teachers were elected at the teacher’s
meeting 29-8-1899:- Superintendent, John Rodda; Librarian, Percy Cropley;
Treasurer, John S. Cropley; Book Steward, Crosby Cropley; Organist, Miss Ella Wallace;
Assistant Organist, Miss Baker. It was recorded that an Anniversary be held on November
18th, 1899, and a picnic in connection with it on the following Tuesday. In
1901, Miss Ella Wallace trained the children for the Anniversary, Also in 1901,
Mr Crosby Cropley was appointed Superintendent, and held this position for 42
years. Mr John S. Cropley was elected assistant superintendent, and also was
chairman at most of the Sunday School teachers’ meetings from 1901 to 1936. In
1944, Mr Reg Cropley became superintendant and remained so for about eight years,
to be followed by Mr David Morley for two years, then Mrs A. L. Morley for nine
years. For the past eleven years, Mr Laurie Morley has held this position, and
his wife, Sandra, has been secretary. Mr Percy Cropley was appointed secretary
in 1900 and held the position for five years. Others to hold this post were:-
J. Bird (2 years), Leslie Paynter (3), Oliver Jarvis (1), Florence Cropley (5),
Roy Cropley (5), Cecil Marshall (5), J. R. W. Cropley (16), R. Cropley (?),
Edna Morley (3), Margaret Morley, now Rowse (7), and Sandra Melhuish now Morley
(11).</p>

<p>An interesting item in the minutes record that, in 1914, the Sunday School at Warragul South
donated six pounds to Belguim Relief Fund, instead of buying prizes for the
children that year. In 1918. according to Warragul Circuit Plan, the name was
changed to Ellinbank Sunday School.</p>

<h4>St. George’s Sunday School</h4>

<p>St. George’s Church of England Sunday School commenced in September 1915 and continued until
the end of 1968. Over the years, the following were superintendants:- Mr Ellis Gilbert
(1915-’32), Reverend Ball (1932-’35), Mrs Priestman (1935-’43), Mrs Kingston
(1943-’46), Mrs Telford (1946-’58), Miss J. Telford (1958-’60), Mr G. Mortimer
(1960-’64), and Miss B. Gilbert (1964-’69). Highlights of the Sunday School
year were the concerts, anniversaries, and the annual Sunday School picnics
held at either Bear Creek, Frankston, Inverloch and Glen Cromie,</p>

<h4>St. Luke’s Sunday School</h4>

<p>As 1968 drew to a close, Sunday School teachers and children from St, George’s Church of
England (which had been burnt down earlier in that year) joined forces with the
Methodists at Ellinbank. The following year, teachers and children from Tetoora
Road added to the numbers. In this Centenary year, the Sunday School
rejoices-in the fact that 74 children and young people are on the roll, with
thirteen dedicated teachers taking the classes.</p>

<p>The founders of the original Warragul South Church and Sunday School would also rejoice to
know that the task they undertook has been so ably continued.</p>

<h4>FIRST HOTEL</h4>

<p>Fred Gould obtained a licence in August 1880 for the South Warragul Hotel, which was situated
at the junction of the present Korumburra - Ellinbank roads, about where St,
Luke’s Anglican - Methodist Co-operating Church now stands.. The licence was
renewed in October 1880, but we could find no further record of this hotel, nor
how long it remained there.</p>

<h4>ELLINBANK PRIMARY SCHOOL</h4>

<p>No. 2189</p>

<p>On August 7th, 1879, the Inspector stated that there were 28 children of school age in the area,
with the nearest school seven miles away over wretched roads, and that David
Smith had offered an acre of land as a site for a school, and a room or shed as
temporary accommodation. The offer was accepted and a school opened in these
temporary premises on 30th September, 1879, with Henry Brent as first head
teacher. A school was built the following year, July 1880, on the present site.
Attendances were low in the 1880’s and the school was worked half time with Seaview
(then known as Warragul South), Samuel Barclay being the teacher. Later in
1885, Chas. Hyland asked for a “horse allowance” to enable him to travel the
seven miles between the two schools. When enrolments increased, Ellinbank was
restored to full time and a new building replaced the old in 1906, John
McDonald of Warragul erected this school at a cost of £340, The old building
was shifted to Clancy’s Cutting (Cloverlea) also in 1903. A junior classroom
was erected at Ellinbank in 1960. The first sewing mistress was Miss Felice
Cropley. In later years. Miss Grace Gilbert became sewing mistress, and held
that position for 15 years. (1916-30). Head teachers to have been appointed
have included Barkley Fraser (1886-1901), Ern Whitelock (1904-1908), H. Greer,
Mr Malcolm. Mr Phillips. Miss Rawlings, Edith Brochie, F. X. Slattery, B. E.
Nankervis, F. Morter, J. Pask, C. Christie. T. Chellew, Duggan, Benaldo, E.
Dunn, Hanaford, Hateley, P. Morris, A. Ainge, R. Porch. M. Torpey, R.
Pangrazio. Items of interest from the 1912-1954 minutes book include a 1912
entry setting the charge for the use of the school for municipal elections at
2/6; 1916. request from head teacher, Mr Malcolm for a half holiday for the
purpose of taking the children rabbiting for patriotic purposes (permission
granted); that three pence each be given to two children to sweep the school
after farmers’ union meeting — “smoking being strictly prohibited”, by order of
the school committee; 1940 entry tells that the committee was short of funds,
so several members gave donations amounting to 14/6 to clear accounts. When the
school obtained a piano it was moved around between the school, “English” Church
and Methodist Church for all social functions at a hire charge of 7/6. concert
charges were two shillings for adults, children half price, and “coffee supper.”</p>

<p>Until the public hall was built in 1930. many of the meetings and social functions were
held in the school.</p>

<p>In this Centenary year, 1974, there are 48 children on the school roll with teachers. Mr
Fairbairn and Mr Rogers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have no early rolls or registers, but are grateful for a roll of past students,
which Mr S. Robinson had preserved among records of the Past Students’
Association.</p>

<p>The dates shown are the year of commencing school;</p>

<p>1879— William Brown, Effield Cropley, Marshall Cropley, Grace Cropley, Felicia Cropley, Prank
Cropley, Jessie Cropley, Annie Cropley, Harry Redmond, . . . Redmond, John
Smith, Sarah Jane Smith, Lucy Annie Smith, John Smith, Thomas Smith, Bridget Quinn,
John Quinn, James Dalgleish, Charles Dalgleish.</p>

<h1>Settlers and Sawmillers</h1>

<h3>by Mike McCarthy</h3>

<h4>Cropley Brothers</h4>

<p>In 1875 five members of the Cropley family, including Ben and Effield, selected adjoining
allotments 11 km south of the site of Darnum station. The brothers had emigrated
from England in 1852 and in 1858 purchased land at Truganina Creek, on the Werribee
plains, southwest of Melbourne. A search for better farming country eventually
brought them to Gippsland where they chose their selections soon after Lardner’s
initial surveys were complete. Together the properties totalled over 1,400 acres,
thickly timbered with Messmate, Blackwood, White Gum and Mountain Ash, to which
would be added an additional 1,000 acres to the east leased by the Cropleys
from 1886.</p>

<p>The Cropleys had good reason for wanting the tram connection to Darnum station. In addition
to providing all-year access to their farms it was also the intention of Ben
and Effield to mill the forest on their land to help offset the cost of
clearing; a common enough practice in this part of the country. In May 1886
they took delivery of a sawmilling plant and contracted William Smith, a
Bloomfield sawmiller and a son of neighbouring Gainsborough settler and former
sawmiller Joseph Smith, to erect the mill. It was positioned on William Cropley’s
land at the end of what was then known as Cheaps Road. Following the collapse
of the Shire sponsored tramway scheme in 1888, the agreement with Smith was
extended to include the laying of a 3 ft gauge tramline into Darnum. By July
1888, a survey had been completed by A. E. Moors, the Shire of Warragul Engineer,
and work had commenced on the construction of the line.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 3" width=387 src="Ben%20Cropley.jpg" alt="Ben Cropley"
    title="Benjamin Cropley (1835–1926)" /></p>

<p>Progress was rapid at first as the gentle grades and comparatively light scrub presented few
engineering difficulties. The alignment was cleared and the formation made
ready for the laying of sleepers by November 1888. Matters changed, however,
when it came to laying the rails. Smith experienced continual delays in the delivery
of the 50 lb per yard and 60 lb per yard rails which had been purchased from
the Victorian Government Railways for £4 10s per ton. Rail laying had started
at the station in September and had steadily progressed with the rails being
laid on half-round sleepers without ballast. Operations could not begin in ernest
until the final shipment of rails arrived in May 1889 although the partly
constructed tramway had been in use since the previous November using horses to
haul the trucks.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 4" width=386 src="Effield%20Cropley.jpg" alt="Effield Cropley"
    title="Effield Cropley (1840-1920)"/></p>

<p>The horses were a temporary measure. Ben Cropley had ordered a locomotive in July 1888
through the Sydney Office of John Fowler and Company of Leeds, England.
According to Fowler’s records the engine left their works in March 1889 and was
delivered to Darnum around May. It was a small 16-ton 0-4-2 saddle tank locomotive
of typical Fowler design, being that firm’s number 5851 of 1888. According to
the quoted specifications, the engine was to be a 9.25 ton tank engine of a
type ‘specially designed for running on rough laid lines and sharp curves. The
locomotive that arrived was much larger. Its size, and the speed at which the order
was filled, suggests that it was in stock at the time the order came through.
The delivered locomotive had cylinders of nine inches diameter with a 14 in
stroke. Its driving wheels were 30in in diameter with a wheelbase of five feet.
The coke-box capacity was 24 cubic feet while the water tank capacity was 280
gallons. Empty it weighed 11.8 tons. The engine and tramway to this stage had
cost £6,000.</p>

<p>After adjustments were made to the track alignment to eliminate some tight curves,
the locomotive commenced to transport the accumulated output of the Cropley
mill and that of Amos and Gunn and the Whiteside brothers, both having been in
operation since March 1889 despatching their timber with horse teams.</p>

<p>The first journey of the locomotive caused some consternation to the driver and his
passengers. Smith had cleared only what he thought was necessary for the track alignment
and had based his work on his past experience which had involved the
construction of tramways for horse traffic. The first trip proved that the
Fowler was considerably wider than a horse! But at least correcting the
formation was made easy by the missing bark on trees where the locomotive had
made contact. Adjustments were also made to the track layout at Darnum station
where the arrangement had consisted of a single approach line which entered the
station yard and curved to the west to run alongside the goods platform. At the
commencement of steam haulage, the goods platform was extended by 150 ft, an
office was constructed and a siding installed in the tramway to hold the laden
timber trucks. The engine always ran at the front of the train so some hand
shunting must have taken place. In 1890 a crane was provided to assist with the
heavy loads both in sawn timber and logs that were by then being handled.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 5" width=1092 src="Cropley's%20locomotive.jpg" alt="Cropley's locomotive"
title="at left: Marshall Cropley;
front of engine: Effield Samuel Cropley" /></p>

<p>The station yard had a gentle slope to the south which created problems on several occasions
with runaway trucks. In one instance this resulted in a bill being presented to
the Cropleys for repairs to the smashed station yard gates and a long walk for
Cropley’s tallyman as the trucks did not come to a rest until they reached Bear
Creek several kilometres to the south!</p>

<p>The tramway proved to be an immediate success catering not only for the needs of the
sawmills but also the many farms through which it passed. A truck load of
potatoes or peas was a common sight at the rear of the train as it entered
Darnum Station. Farmers would stack their produce alongside the line ready for
collection by Cropley’s driver. Robert Worth was one of many who paid the
Cropleys for this service. Passengers were also carried, although no special
provision was made for them. Usually they were required to perch on top of a
load of timber or make themselves comfortable on bags of potatoes, but, if the
day was particularly chilly and Bill Edwards or Marshall Cropley, the drivers,
were feeling charitable, one or two people could often be accommodated on the
footplate. This may have provided some relief but the open cab would have
ensured a miserable trip on a wet winter’s day. Even as late as 1898, a ride on
the tram had not lost its appeal for some. The reporter for the Guardian
considered it to be a “most exhilarating experience, the sharp curves and steep
grades being somewhat trying for a person with ‘weak nerves’!”</p>

<p>On one occasion a special train was run to carry prospective buyers to the sale of J. C.
Cox’s property south of Darnum. Cox, and several other farmers along the line,
had short wooden-rail sidings running off the main line on which they stored
their own trucks for use when the roads to Darnum became impassable. The locomotive
would, when required, collect the trucks on one of its trips into Darnum. Some
farmers preferred to use their own horse teams as did the stave splitters, two
of whom made daily trips over the tramway in 1893.</p>

<p>The use being made of the tramway by others, prompted Ben Cropley to seek support from the
Shire for a change to the Tramway Act in 1897. He wanted owners of tramways to
be legally able to charge freight on their lines. Cropley stated that the
tramway ‘has been a greater boon to those who have had the use of it than it
has been to us.’ Nothing came of the proposed change.</p>

<p>The tramway was also a source of entertainment for the local boys. It was common practice,
particularly in the early days of operation, for the lads to borrow a tram
truck and use it to roll down the log line serving Cropley’s mill. Similarly,
for those wishing to fish the Bear Creek it became practice to ‘borrow’ a truck
in the Darnum station yard and use it to coast out to the Bear Creek bridge.
After a couple of near misses and a collision between a truck carrying a number
of passengers and a loaded log truck, the practice was discouraged.</p>

<p>Not all interference with tramway rolling stock was innocent. In the depressed times of
the early to mid 1890s the absence of employment saw an increase in vandalism which
prompted the following commentary:</p>

<p class='offset'>To the Darnum larrikin nothing is sacred. They overturn trollies in the station yard, place
obstacles on Cropley’s tramway, rob orchards and backyards, and damage property
with a most indiscriminate disregard for the rights of others. Not long ago the
owner of a trolley, which was standing in a yard, thought he had made it secure
by locking a chain round the wheels. But what does the Darnum larrikin care for
locks and chains. He simply wrenched the whole thing off, and overturned the
trolley in the bargain. Other owners of trollies have been similarly treated. A
short time ago Mr Cox was bringing his cream down the tramway on a trolley when
he fortunately noticed an obstruction placed across the rails - a big piece of
wood of the size of a sleeper. He of course removed the obstacle, and avoided
the accident. But supposing the engine had come steaming along and the driver
had failed to notice the obstruction, nothing could have saved the engine being
thrown off the rails and human life might have been lost. It was a dastardly
thing to do, and an effort should be made to discover the offender and punish
him severely. They have also interfered with the engine at times, and are up to
all kinds of mischievous tricks.</p>

<p>Part of the journey from Darnum to the mills saw the tram pass along Cheaps Road (now
Gainsborough Road). Following complaints from residents the Warragul Shire Council
wrote to the Cropleys urging them not to interfere with road traffic or cause
fright to horses on the roadway. The Council suggested that the engine should
be stopped whenever a horse nearby appeared frightened!</p>

<p>A normal tram consisted of five loaded trucks but the locomotive could probably have handled
more, there being only one adverse grade from the Bear Creek up to the station.</p>

<p>This descent to Bear Creek was to be the scene of several derailments, a typical example
being that which took place in October 1894 and was described by the correspondent
of the Warragul Guardian as follows:</p>

<p class='offset'>On Tuesday afternoon the locomotive belonging to Messrs Cropley Bros was making the usual
trip, bringing five trollies heavily loaded with sawn timber from the mills at Gainsborough.
All went well until the Bear Creek Hill was reached and the usual precautions
were taken for the descent. Some of the wheels were spragged and the train
rolled down, of course gathering ‘way’ as she went. On reaching the place where
the line is elevated on huge logs one of the trollies left the rails and before
those on the engine knew what had happened the whole five loads were a wreck. A
boy named Davis was riding in the trolley next to the engine, and being thrown
from the top of the load was covered by the falling timber, only his hands
being visible. Help was at once rendered, but a great quantity of timber had to
be shifted, the workers (one of them was a lady passenger) fearing all the time
to find the poor lad terribly injured, if not killed, but to their great
surprise and joy found him positively uninjured. It was a really marvellous
escape, and can only be accounted for by supposing that some of the timber fell
crosswise and lodged on the high logs, thus forming a hollow and saving the
boy. Three of the trollies belonged to Mr Gunn and the other two to Messrs
Cropley. Some of them were badly smashed - wheels were off, axles bent and
things were generally ‘very much messed’. On Wednesday a strong body of men
came in from the mills and set to work, but their united efforts were required
from half past six a.m. until past noon before order was once more restored. Fortunately,
the engine was not thrown off, for it would have been a serious matter at that
particular spot had that happened.</p>

<p>The spark arrester was sometimes removed over the Bear Creek section to provide a little
extra power for the climb up the creek valley although this must have contributed
to the frequency of fires along the route. In common with other steam-hauled
tramways operating through farmland, frequent complaints were received by the
operators over the summer months concerning grass fires alongside the formation
after the locomotive had passed by. In October 1897 this tendency to start
fires was brought home to the Cropleys when a fire, allegedly started by the
Fowler, threatened the mill. Only the prompt action of the mill hands saved it
from destruction.</p>

<p>A more damaging conflagration occurred three months later as part of the disastrous
1898 bush fires when a kilometre of track was destroyed. The iron rails were ‘snapped
asunder or twisted into eccentric shapes by the huge burning trees’ and
sleepers were ‘smashed to splinters’.’ The line closed for a week while fallen
trees were removed, new sleepers laid and the bent and twisted rails
straightened. The 1898 fires were ferocious in this part of the country with
many outlying farms destroyed. Effield Cropley lost everything, including his
house. At Darnum station, the station building and platform were damaged and a
large stock of Blackwood in the yard was destroyed.</p>

<p>At the mill an open-end engine shed was built over a loop line running around the mill. A
square water tank raised on poles supplied water to the locomotive. The scrap
wood used for fuel was loosely stacked nearby.</p>

<p>Whenever the tramway stopped working for more than a couple of days, the first people to
feel the effect were the Darnum shopkeepers, particularly if the stoppage occurred
in Winter. For not only were the outlying settlers dependent on the tramway to
assist them in earning a livelihood, but the Darnum merchants relied on the business
from the mills for their living. Fortunately stoppages were rare, the cause
usually being fires or a breakdown of the locomotive, but in 1892, due to the low
timber prices and the lack of orders, the mills ceased operating from January
to August and then worked spasmodically through to the end of 1893. The occasional
trip was made by the locomotive to service the stave splitters requiring goods
to be transported into Darnum station but little else was despatched. Men were laid
off at the mills which further reduced the business of the Darnum shopkeepers
and on several occasions during the depression years, the local papers reported
that Darnum was near poverty-stricken.</p>

<p>During times when the mills were stopped for protracted periods, the men would be laid off.
Making a living became quite a task with many working for low wages clearing
farmers’ properties while others engaged in trapping. In 1893 the Warragul News
commented that ‘Oppossums appear to be most abundant, but the trappers also
catch wallabies, wombats, bears, paddy-melons, etc.</p>

<p>In all, Cropley’s mill occupied four sites at Gainsborough during the 15 years of its
existence. The first was on William Cropley’s selection where it remained for
only a short time. By March 1890 it had been moved onto Arthur Wright’s “Hazeldean”,
several kilometres to the east. Along with fellow sawmillers, Amos and Gunn,
the Cropleys had leased part of Wright’s land in January 1889 at an annual
rental of £15.</p>

<p>On Wright’s land, Cropley’s mill was contained within a mill shed measuring 110 ft by 50
ft. The average output was between 3,000 and 4,000 super feet and 24 men were
employed.</p>

<p>In March 1896 the plant was shifted onto Sandman and Topp’s property six kilometres to the
west. Here it remained for two years before another move took place to Effield
Cropley’s block 1.5 km closer to the original site.</p>

<p>In each case, the rails serving the cut-out mill site were lifted and relaid to serve the new
location. An additional one mile of rails was leased from the Victorian Railways
in 1896 at the time of the move to Sandman and Topp’s property. Log tramways
were laid from all three sites and from along the main line although only the
route taken from the third mill site is still evident today in the hillside
behind the former mill.</p>

<p>Until October 1896 the mill was managed by Effield’s son, Marshall, and was cutting mainly
White Gum, Messmate and Mountain Ash. Marshall sold most of his output through
the Melbourne timber merchants, Quiggan Brothers. Following his death from pneumonia,
the job was taken over by Arthur Fritz, a long-time employee of the Cropleys.
The engine driver at the mill was Tom Herand, who took over the task after the
loss of his left hand, in an accident in the log yard in 1896, prevented him
from working in the yard again. Herand’s arm had been crushed in the incident and,
although he was despatched to the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne on the afternoon
train, the doctors were unable to save his hand. The mill workers and the
people of Darnum raised £10 3s 9d towards the cost of an artificial hand for
him. His wife ran the kitchen at the mill.</p>

<p>Such accidents were common but not always with such severe results. In 1897 Cropley’s
henchman, John Bagot, was hit in the chest by a large flitch which had been caught
by the saw and flung at him. He was lucky to survive. The Guardian reported
that ‘many instances have been cited where a piece of timber catching the saw on
being returned has been sent flying through the roof of the mill.’</p>

<h4>Smith</h4>

<p>Four other mills were connected to Cropley’s tram by wooden or steel branch lines. William
Smith, who built the tramway and mill for the Cropley brothers in 1888-89, had
moved his mill from Bloomfield in 1887. He erected it on his father’s property
six kilometres west from where the Cropleys were to place their mill. It was a
case of the return of the prodigal son, as the plant was that originally owned
by Overend and Selman, the first of the Darnum sawmillers. The mill had been removed
from the district seven years earlier when it was sold to William’s father,
Joseph. Smith milled the Messmate, White Gum and Mountain Ash on this and the
adjoining block owned by David Smith (no relation!). He carted his timber to
Warragul by bullock team until February 1896 when the tramway to serve Cropley’s
second site was laid close by Smith’s mill. A steel rail branch line laid to
the mill allowed daily visits by the locomotive to pick up Smith’s timber.</p>

<p><img id="Picture 7" width=386 src="William%20Smith.jpg" alt="William Smith"
    title="William Smith (1857-1942)"/></p>

<p>Not much is known of Smith’s mill other than that he employed about 16 men who he
apparently drove very hard. Allegedly he could match the Cropley output even
though the latter firm normally employed about 24 men. Smith contemplated
placing a ‘motor engine’ on the tramway in 1900 because of the large output that
he was achieving at that time. Exactly what this was intended to be is anyone’s
guess for he did not follow through with the proposal.</p>
<p>In 1911 William Smith moved the mill to Weeaproinah in the Otways, where he 
continued sawmilling for approximately another six years.</p>

<h2>THE PATH OF PROGESS</h2>
<h3>by Hugh Copeland</h3>
<p>
[pg 24-25]
</p><p>
Coming back again to the flat country, Charles Cox, as previously
mentioned, took up a selection. James Dobbie also sold his at £8
an acre. He was a brother-in-law of Charles Ditterich and followed
him over to Korumburra where he was coal-mining for
several years. Farther along was Andrew Gray, who with his family
lived there for a long time. Bob Gray was managing the Bona
Vista estate for T. B. Guest, where he had charge of a large
number of men engaged in clearing the land on which Mr Guest
laid out a fortune. Then Michael Neville had land west of
Keeble's which fell into the hands of the banks and was rented
by William Whiteside from the western district, who afterwards
selected at Bena.
</p><p>
Next came the Beasley brothers, who resided there for some
years. J. Davis was also an old resident there when the district
became known as Gainsborough and Mr Davis was appointed postmaster.
</p><p>
Thomas Strickland came up from Geelong and with great energy
and expenditure bought and cleared some of the selections in this
locality, thus adding considerably to the value of the land, some of
which was afterwards sold at prices ranging up to £127 per acre.
</p><p>
We now come to the Cropley family, who selected land in
the early days, and whose descendants are nearly as numerous as
the sands on the sea-shore.
</p><p>
Two uncles and three nephews took up blocks, just under MacDonald's 
Track, taking in partly flat and partly hill country. Benjamin
and Effield, the uncles, were brothers, W. J. and John Cropley,
brothers, were their nephews, and Alfred Cropley, another
nephew, was a cousin of William and John's.
</p><p>
The Cropley family were probably unique in one respect, four
of the elder brothers having married four sisters, and at home
three brothers married three sisters.
</p><p>
The Cropleys selected in 1878; and to get to their land, turned
off the road from Melbourne at Drouin West, following the road
south from Drouin to the Burnt Store corner, then across to
Lardner's Track, down Lardner's Track to Minnieburn (Hunter's).
Then by the track known as Blaizes through the trees and thence to
their selections.
</p><p>
Ben Cropley, his brother Effield and the nephews, came up
from Werribee.  He was used to carting to the diggings in the
early days, but, what with stumps and other obstacles, they were very
much in doubt as to whether they would reach South Warragul.
However, to those who knew the Cropleys, a bit of bad road would
not hinder them, and their efforts in battling against all the trials
of the early days has hardly been surpassed by any other selectors.
</p><p>
Up on MacDonald's Track, John Ashcroft selected, and for
many years was the connecting link between Warragul and the
Track with his teams.
</p><p>
The Arnolds were next along the Track, of whom, the best
known of a large family were Frank and Albert. Their father was
the first man to introduce stoving, or burning out stumps by fire.
Mr Arnold deserves more than passing mention of this wonderful
improvement in the methods of clearing timber country, and only
those who went through the labour and expense of grubbing out
stumps and roots can appreciate the difference it made. In fact, it
revolutionized the whole problem of clearing the land.
</p><p>
West of John Cropley was Joseph Smith. He was originally
following up the goldfields before he came to select. He used to
claim that he was a direct descendant of Mormon Smith, and certainly
there was a resemblance to that prophet of plurality on the
question of wives. He was looked on as an expert in blending and
sowing grass-seed, and his services were in great request in the
early days for that important work.
</p><p>
David Smith was north of him, and worked his land for a
number of years, and carried on the Ellinbank post office. He sold
out to W. H . Kingston, ultimately engaging in business in Melbourne
as a fruit merchant. A grandson, Warne Smith, was a star
player for the Melbourne Football Club.
</p><p>
[pg 266]
</p><p>
Cropley Brothers and Co. now proposed to construct a tramline
from Darnum to their Gainsborough sawmill. These enterprising
men were doing for themselves what the council tried to do,
without success. The public works department soon got wind of the
proposal, and wrote to the council inquiring on what terms the council
had granted permission. The line was eventually constructed,
and in such a substantial way that iron rails were used, and a small
locomotive hauled the trucks along the line, loaded with the timber
from several sawmills, as well as transporting goods for the settlers
along the route.
</p><p>
Mr Moors, the shire engineer, having resigned, James Daskein,
from Yea, was appointed in his place, at a salary of £300, and no
private practice. The matter of a water-supply for the town advanced
another step in 1888, when the shire president was asked to
convene a meeting to discuss the question. The councillors of the
day were alive to the fact that a good water-supply means something
of a progressive nature in attracting population to the place,
and helping to keep those who are there. The president called the
meeting without hesitation, and his name should be honoured for
helping to attain what the people of Warragul have now—a plentiful
supply of good water, which has never been restricted, even in
the driest year.
</p><p>
A notice of motion was tabled by Cr Connor regarding the floating
of a new loan, for an amount that the council could legally
borrow, to construct main roads, erect a shire hall and other specified
works. This action was taken at the close of the year 1888, and the
amount of the loan was ultimately fixed at £11,500. The Commercial
Bank offered to take up the loan at par for 5 per cent, with a
charge of 1 per cent commission, but the council decided to offer
debentures for the amount required.
</p><p>
[pg 336-341]
</p><p>
The first building used for entertainments in Warragul was
known as Trinca's Hall, and was on the corner where the New
South Wales Bank now stands. The material used in building it
was sawn at Trinca's mill near-by. Later the building was shifted
bodily by Joe Kidd and a bullock-team, further up the street, opposite
the site of the Club Hotel, and was used by Phillip P. Nind as
a printing office when he started a paper called the Warragul Guardian.
This building was lately demolished to make room for the
modern shops which now occupy the site.
</p><p>
John Trinca built a residence for himself on the north side of
Queen Street, where the Utility Motor garage now stands, and
afterwards was married to a Miss Warnock. The house was acquired
later by Dr Lyster Nolan, who sold it in turn to Dr Hayes, and it
was finally disposed of to Mr Jeanes, for removal, who re-erected it
on his property in Albert Street, Warragul. Trinca sold his interests
in Warragul shortly after his marriage, and went to live near
Melbourne. Two of his sons are doctors, and practising their profession
in the suburbs.
</p><p>
Overend and Selman, about 1880, worked a sawmill for a short
time near Darnum, but found that the timber they were cutting was
unsaleable, and gave up the business. William Smith bought their
portable engine, shifting it to James Biram's selection, where he
started sawing timber. Biram's block was on the south side of the
Prince's Highway, between John O'Connor's Killarney Park and
the showgrounds. He built a brick house later on the north-west
corner, where it now stands.
</p><p>
Among early saw-millers in the Warragul timber country, William
Smith took a leading part. Those engaged in the business
found it was no use waiting for roads to be made, so provided their
own means of transporting the sawn timber from the mills to the
railway. This generally meant the construction of tram-lines, with
wooden rails, which were cut at the mills, and laid on split sleepers.
the lines sometimes being ballasted with sawdust, of which there
were always abundant heaps, Horses were used to pull the trollies,
which were strongly constructed, with flanged wheels and good
brakes. Large quantities of splendid timber were brought in to the
railway-station every day by these means, where men were permanently
engaged in classing it and loading it into trucks for despatching
to the market. Andy Banks was a well-known man on the tram
track, who had a fine team of draught-horses, and hauled sawn
timber to the station for some years from the mills that were working
out the timber on the south side of the railway-line. When the
timber was cut out there, he went over to Western Australia, where
he carried on the same sort of work amongst the mines.
</p><p>
The Cropley family, with their usual enterprise, put in a big
sawmilling plant on W. T. Cropley's selection at Ellinbank, and
constructed a tram-line seven miles long from there to the Darnum
railway-station. This line was more permanently laid down than
most of the others, and had iron rails. A small locomotive was
used, which was driven for some time by Bill Edwards, whose son
is following in his father's footsteps, and runs the locomotive used
by the Forestry Commission on their timber line at Erica.
</p><p>
Cropley's mill was called the Gainsborough mill, after the place
the family came from in England, and afterwards designated the
district to the vicinity. That wonderful old pioneer, Ben Cropley,
was the guiding spirit in this big enterprise, and the task of surmounting
the initial difficulties of getting it started fell largely on
his shoulders. William Smith laid down this plant, and also the iron
tram-line from the mill to Darnum, which was a big undertaking in
those days, when the timber was so thick that a local wit declared
that "a dog couldn't bark in it." However, the men of that period
were hardy people, who relied on their own energies, and surmounted
difficulties that would be referred to the government in
later times.
</p><p>
Cropley's mill, as it was generally known, was worked with a
staff of twenty-four men, and the average output of sawn timber
was about 4000 feet per day. The timber was good in the forest
round the site of the mill, running out to the foothills of the Strzlecki
Ranges, and taking in some of the now famous flat country.
Experienced bushmen, who could tell by sounding the butts with an
axe if they were piped, felled the trees, and seldom made a mistake.
They sawed the logs into lengths, and teams of bullocks were used
to snig them in to the mill. There the logs were rolled on to a sloping
skidway, with cant-hooks, where the bark was taken off and the butt
ends squared, and laid conveniently for skidding on to the bench,
prior to being broken down with a big circular saw. Rollers and
miniature trams brought the large flitches of timber to the smaller
saw-benches, which turned out the finished article in studs, wallplates,
joists, weatherboards, pickets, and any special lengths and
sizes required by market demands.
</p><p>
A little settlement usually sprang up near the sawmill, where
rough buildings were erected out of waste timber, where the men
camped, and sometimes their families with them. There was usually
the mill boarding-house, with a larger building and other sheds,
stabling, etc., made up, with the large milling plant roofed in, quite
an imposing little village, which hummed with activity, and was an
important scene of industry in those times.
</p><p>
Had it not been for the privately constructed tram-lines running
out from the railway in different directions, there would have been
little hope of getting the timber to market. The tram from Cropley's
mill served a useful purpose in many ways, and besides all the
timber cut at their own mill the output of four other mills was carried
on it. In addition, there was a large quantity of split timber
being got out of the bush; blackwood staves especially were being
split in thousands, as there were a lot of very fine blackwood-trees
to the south of Darnum, on the flat country, for which the land-owners
were paid a royalty by the splitters. Large stacks of the
staves were to be seen at the time in some of the station yards, and
there appeared to be a keen demand for them. This trade gradually
came into the hands of the Unger brothers, who commenced the
business as splitters, and worked all round the district wherever there
was suitable timber. Ernest Unger, who lived in Warragul for
some years, was well known, and was a very quiet, retiring man, who
was not generally known to have large interests in some branches of
the timber trade.
</p><p>
Others who dealt in staves and split timber about that time, were
the Condon brothers, Sam Parsons, who was granted the second carrier's
licence issued in Warragul; the Croles, hard-working men,
the father and two sons, George and William. The late G. J. Turner
had some splendid blackwood timber on his block, where the
Kennedy family bought in later. He made a lot of money from
royalties and sales, and nearly every block in that vicinity was noted
for its fine timber. It must still be remembered that the Cropley's
tram-line was a boon to the splitters and timber-getters at this time,
for, even after many years, it was impossible to get a load of anything
to the railway in the winter months, around the Gainsborough
district, when Tom .Strickland's efforts to have his road made were
numerous and persistent.
</p><p>
Getting back to the sawmills, a brief description of those that
were working around the Warragul district will be of interest.
</p><p>
William Smith worked a mill on his father's block at South
Warragul for some time, and cut a large quantity of timber in
that vicinity. This mill used to turn out from 8000 to 9750 feet
of sawn timber per day, with a staff of sixteen men. The timber
cut was swamp-gum, off the flats, in certain parts of the year, and
blackbutt, with white-gum and white messmate on the higher
ground. Ben Cropley, who employed twenty-four men, couldn't
make out how Smith's mill cut twice as much per day as theirs, with
sixteen men. Smith said he had better men, and kept them going.
At one time there was a notable boxer in his gang, who was said
to be the champion of South Melbourne. When he was first put
on the pay-roll he worked well, but slackened off as he found it
getting too strenuous, so Bill told him he could draw his money
next day, and knock off. The pugilistic gentleman breathed out
threatenings and slaughter, and told some of the other men that
he would give the boss a good hammering before he left. After
he had received his cheque, and nothing happened, one of the men
told Smith what he had missed, but he said the man could have been
obliged if he wanted to fight, and he would have been invited to
have it out on the big heap of sawdust, if anything like that had
been suggested.
</p><p>
In recounting the incident. Bill Smith said that it was a necessary
qualification in a man who ran a sawmill in those days to be able
to use his fists, and he quite thought that less timber would have
been handled if he had been afraid of threats to fight when men
were told what he wanted them to do.
</p><p>
An interesting fact was related to the writer by Smith, in regard
to the value of the timber when the sawmills were in full swing,
and said that it must be remembered that the price of sawn timber
at the time he was speaking of was from 5s. to 7s. 6d. per hundred
feet.
</p><p>
The Lands Department then were anxious to find out what
amount of timber there was on a given area of land, and what the
value of it was, if sold. One of the departmental officers asked
Smith if he could give him the information, and suggested that the
figures would be appreciated referring to a full selection of 320
acres.
</p><p>
Mr Smith replied that he could supply the information, but they
would have to give him some little time to make it up, because his
mill was operating on several blocks, and he would require to
analyse the figures in order to get them correctly as regards the one
section. However, he did work it out, and says that the figures,
which he supplied to the Lands Department, are, beyond doubt,
where the record is still kept. The record shows that the timber cut
on his father's (Joseph Smith's) selection (320 acres) realized
£32,000 on the open market. This seems incredible at the present
day, with the country denuded of trees and the dense forests of
bygone days only a memory, but nevertheless true.
</p><p>
William Smith, during the war, was sawmilling at Beech Forest,
where he sold out his timber reserve and milling plant for £4000,
when timber was bringing 10s. per 100 feet. Shortly after, it
jumped to 28s., when he could have got double the money. Knotts
had four mills in the same locality, which they sold at £l0,000 each,
with a much inferior reserve of timber than Smith had. In recounting
his experience, William Smith remarked that "it was one
of the bits of bad luck which hurts."
</p><p>
Others interested in the timber trade and sawmilling industries
about this time were Charles Sargeant, who had a mill working for
some time, to the south-west of Warragul. Its first location was
on Mrs Walsh's property, just beyond the present site of the public
hospital. There was a fine lot of sawing timber all round that part,
and a tram-line was constructed to bring it in to the railway-station.
As the timber was cut out, the mills were moved on to fresh supplies,
and Sargeant's was later, some distance further on, at Minnieburn.
The men who followed sawmilling work were experts in the
different departments they were engaged in, and seldom did anything
else. The principal benchman was one on whom a great deal
depended, for it was his ability in making the most out of a log,
and cutting it true to gauge, which got the mill a good name. Bert
Jaggs was a well-known benchman in the eighties, and was working
with Sargeant's mill for some time. He afterwards became attached
to W. Ashcroft's hay and corn business in Warragul as
book-keeper; a fine character, and well liked by all who knew him.

The first agricultural show held at Warragul under the auspices
of the Warragul and West Gippsland Agricultural Society
was held on 20 March, 1885, on a piece of land between Connor
Street and Bowen Street, the sale yards at the eastern end, belonging
to A. C. Lyons of the Club Hotel, were used for the stock
exhibits, whilst the farm and dairy produce were shown in the
Athenaeum Hall in Queen Street.
</p><p>
A Melbourne reporter for one of the weekly papers, in his
account of the proceedings sent by telegraph from Warragul, said,
"The weather was fine to-day," which seemed to surprise him
more than the size of the pigs or the quality of the potatoes he
witnessed on that memorable occasion, whilst he should have been
staggered by the excellence of W. T. Crojdey's butter, which
annexed the first prize at the first show in Warragul, an action he
has repeated on several occasions since, to the annoyance of other
exhibitors.
</p><p>
It is estimated that 1500 people attended the show, and £45
was taken at the gate, which must have been a tribute to the
honesty of those people who paid to go in, for there was nothing
to keep them out, and the oldest inhabitant doesn't even remember
that there was a gate, but that may be due to the fact that he
had a member's ticket.
</p><p>
The event seemed to have attracted a number of parliamentary
members as there were no less than five there, including the
hon. the Minister of Agriculture, J. V. Levein, James Buchanan,
M.L.C., F. C, Mason, M.L.A., member for the district, and
Mr Yeo, M.L.A.

[pg 396-397]
</p><p>
John Rogers, after selling Churchill Island at Westernport,
came to Brandy Creek, and took up a selection, and as a result of
the experiments he had asked James Hann to carry out, he sowed
rye grass and clover seed on about a hundred and fifty acres, after
the scrub had been cut and burnt on it, in 1871, when everyone
in the neighbourhood was astonished at the luxuriant growth it
made. His example was quickly followed by others, and from
that time on, the problem of finding feed for their stock was solved.
</p><p>
The rich chocolate soil, made still more responsive by the
large additions of potash from the fires when the scrub and timber
was burnt, produced wonderful results, and made an ideal seed bed
for grasses and clovers.
</p><p>
The practical members of the band of selectors who came with
the crowd in 1873-8, were able to carry out a good deal of the
necessary work connected with sowing down the grass, after the
scrub had been burnt, but there were a large number who had
taken up land, quite ignorant of the process. These settlers were
dependent on others, and especially in regard to sowing the correct
quantities and in mixing the different varieties of seeds which were
considered most suitable at that time.
</p><p>
Some of the new settlers posed as experts in sowing the grass
seed and built up reputations which kept them constantly employed
during the spring and autumn months. Their engagements were
often booked weeks ahead, and their arrival was as eagerly waited
for as that of the threshing machine in later years.
</p><p>
Joe Smith, who had a selection south of Warragul, was an
authority on sowing grass, and knew all about mixing the seed as
well. His services were often sought, and his arrival was always
an impressive one, when his duties would begin with due deliberation.
First a large sheet was spread out on the floor of a shed, then
the bags of seed would be placed in a row—little bags, big bags
and middling sized bags, each containing different varieties, after
that, particulars of the area to be sown were asked, and then the
scales would be procured, and the different proportions of seed
weighed out, and tipped on the sheet. Some mixtures included
rye grass, cow grass, white clover, cocksfoot, fog, rib grass and
alsyke. With advanced knowledge, some of these would be looked
on as weeds nowadays, but it was looked on as good mixture in those
times. Anyway, so many pounds of this and so many pounds of
the other would all be thoroughly mixed up by Mr Smith, the
expert, and he would start operations on the burn, which had been
prepared, by picking up all the small timber and charred logs left
by the fire. Soon after the sowing, the seed would begin to sprout,
and in a short time the ground would be tinged with green.
